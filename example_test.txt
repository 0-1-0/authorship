This is an action of assumpsit for money had and received to the use of the plaintiffs. They were carriers of goods by road between Victoria and New South Wales. The sums of money were fees which they paid for permits issued under s. 22 of the State Transport (Co-ordination) Act 1931 as amended. Section 28 of the Act made it an offence to carry goods for any consideration without a permit unless a licence or exemption was held under the Act. The plaintiffs held no such licence or exemption. Under s. 36 a person who committed such an offence was liable to a penalty. Section 47 provided: "(2) An authorized officer may seize any motor vehicle or any books, records, or papers in respect of which he suspects that an offence has been or is being committed by any person against this Act, and may detain the same pending investigation and legal proceedings." The plaintiffs allege that the sums of money were not paid by them voluntarily. Their case consists of two branches: that they paid these sums under protest, and that they paid to save the motor vehicle while it was being driven in New South Wales from being seized under s. 47(2). (at p118)

2. The action is brought in consequence of the decision of the Privy Council in Hughes and Vale Pty. Ltd. v. State of New South Wales (1955) AC 241; (1954) 93 CLR 1 All the sums of money in question were collected by the defendant before that decision was announced. They were, in truth, collected on the faith of the "transport cases" decided in this Court. But the decision of the Privy Council revealed that the defendant had in truth no lawful authority to require any of these sums to be paid because the plaintiffs were inter-State carriers. From the lack of lawful authority to collect these sums no presumption that the plaintiffs did not pay them voluntarily can be made. They must prove affirmatively that they paid under compulsion in order to succeed in the action: see Brisbane v. Dacres [1813] EngR 486; (1913) 5 Taunt 143, at p 152 [1813] EngR 486; (128 ER 641, at p 645) and Julian v. Auckland Corporation (1927) NZLR 453 (at p118)

3. The statement of claim contains an allegation that the amounts claimed were demanded by the defendant colore officii. I can see no support at all for that allegation. Extortion in the discharge of an office occurs where illegal or excessive fees are demanded by an officer for the performance of a duty to which the payer is entitled: see Werrin v. The Commonwealth [1938] HCA 3; (1938) 59 CLR 150, at p 158 The plaintiffs had no right to the issue of a permit under the Act. It was beyond the constitutional power of the defendant to apply the provisions of the Act relating to permits to transportation among the States. Their right to recover back what they paid for the permits which were, in fact, issued to them depends upon whether the evidence proves that they paid under compulsion. The only witness was the plaintiff, Mason. He was the driver of the vehicle in respect of which the permits were issued. His evidence is fully set out in the transcript of proceedings before me and I do not repeat it here. This evidence proves these facts. Before the plaintiffs began carrying goods between Victoria and New South Wales, Mason said he had conversations with other drivers from whom he learned that they objected to paying for permits and his evidence shows that he affected to believe that it was unconstitutional to apply the provisions of the Act to inter-State transport. He knew that inter-State hauliers had adopted a policy of paying under protest. His predecessor in business, Mason said in evidence, drew his attention to the provisions of s. 47(2) and told him that if the plaintiffs did not obtain permits their motor vehicle could be detained. The plaintiffs arranged with the consignors or consignees, on whose behalf they carried goods, to include in the price they paid for carriage the fees, or a substantial part of them, which would be payable for permits. Mason, on all occasions when he drove into New South Wales or was about to drive back to Victoria, applied for permits covering the journeys to be travelled within the former State. On most occasions he paid under protest for the permits. What he generally said amounted to this: that he should not have to pay at all and that he expected that the pending case about the Transport Act would be successful and the money would be refunded to him. Other details of Mason's evidence were that inspectors asked drivers of motor vehicles carrying goods to show their permits and checked them. Mason gave evidence of a specific occasion when a vehicle was stopped by an inspector because the driver had no permit and of one occasion when the witness, himself, was asked to show his permit. According to Mason's evidence the inspector told him that the consequence of not having a permit would be that he would be prosecuted. This is the only evidence of any express threat. However, Mason did have a permit and the inspector's statement would appear to be gratuitous. The law does not regard money paid under a threat of legal proceedings as received to the use of the payer and hence recoverable by him. There is no evidence that Mason was forced to apply for a permit on any of the occasions in question or even that any officer of the defendant made any express demand for payment before Mason handed over the money. On the contrary, the evidence clearly proves that Mason, on his own initiative, carried out every detail of the procedure involved in obtaining a permit, from weighing the loaded vehicle to paying the cheque for the fees payable on the issue of the permit. The only evidence of opposition on his part was that he paid under protest. Payment under protest is consistent with voluntary payment. "I do not think that the mere fact of a payment under protest would be sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to succeed; but I think that it affords some evidence, when accompanied by other circumstances, that the payment was not voluntarily made to end the matter": see Maskell v. Horner (1915) 3 KB 106, per Reading L.C.J. (1915) 3 KB, at p 120 In Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Dodge County Commissioners [1878] USSC 131; (1879) 98 US 541 (25 Law Ed 196), this was said: "There are, no doubt, cases to be found in which the language of the court, if separated from the facts of the particular case under consideration, would seem to imply that a protest alone was sufficient to show that the payment was not voluntary; but on examination it will be found that the protest was used to give effect to the other attending circumstances" (1879) 98 US, at p 544 (25 Law Ed, at p 197) There is no evidence here that any payment made under protest was attended by any circumstances that amounted to constraint or pressure to pay, so that it could be said that payment was made to end a deadlock and the protest was made to show that the payer did not regard the payment as closing the transaction. Therefore, I think that the protests provide no ground on which the plaintiffs can succeed. I think that it is clear from the general tenor of the protests which Mason made that he was merely reserving his right to claim back the money if the pending appeal to the Privy Council should succeed. The appeal was Hughes and Vale Pty. Ltd. v. State of New South Wales (1955) AC 241; (1954) 93 CLR 1 (at p120)

4. The evidence that inspectors were on duty on the roads to see if drivers had correct permits shows, of course, that the State was administering the Act. But such evidence no more proves that Mason paid under compulsion than does the evidence of the issuing of permits and the collection of fees for them. Presumably all the carriers knew that the Act was not a dead letter. If it matters that Mason was told by his predecessor in business about s. 47(2), that he saw inspectors on the roads and had his permit checked, the result might be to put the plaintiffs in a better position to recover back the payments which Mason made for permits, than a carrier who had not had s. 47(2) brought to his notice, or had never met an inspector on the roads. But would not that be a strange result? All carriers, as I have said, must be taken to have known that the State was administering the Act. If the fact that the State was doing so proves that it was exacting money by duress, then no carrier could be held to have paid voluntarily. Obviously that would be too large an assumption to make. I think that it would be giving a false character to s. 47(2) or to any other sanctions provided by the Act and to the mere fact that the Act was being administered, to say that these things constituted a threat or an intimidatory announcement. The material question is whether any officer of the defendant threatened to use the powers in s. 47(2) against Mason if he did not obtain permits. There is no evidence that any officer ever made a threat to Mason to compel him to pay for a permit. Of course, if there were, it would be reasonable to conclude that thereafter Mason did not make any payment for a permit voluntarily. Proof that any other carrier's vehicle was stopped because its owner had no permit and that he thereafter paid involuntarily for a permit (if he did), does not prove that Mason (who had never had his vehicle seized or threatened with seizure) did not always pay voluntarily. Where a person complies with the law you cannot presume that he does so in fear of the possible consequences of disobeying it. Voluntary obedience to a law is compatible with knowledge that it contains drastic means of dealing with disobedience. All Mason's overt acts, except possibly his protests, tend to show that he voluntarily paid the sums of money expended on permits. I have stated my view as to the insufficiency of the protests as proof of compulsion. The protests are evidence of dissatisfaction, no doubt, but that is not enough. The inter-State carriers as a body decided in advance to pay under protest, and Mason was merely following that policy. There is no evidence that any officer constrained Mason by any action or threat of action to pay for any permit, and that in order to secure the use of the motor vehicle Mason obtained a permit and protested in order to show that the transaction was not closed and that he reserved his rights to rip up the transaction and recover back what he paid. Mason knew before he embarked on the business of carrying goods between Victoria and New South Wales that it involved, as the law then stood, paying for permits. If he was not willing to pay for permits it was open to him to sue for an injunction quia timet to restrain the defendant from seizing his motor vehicle in the event of his not obtaining permits: see Cam & Sons Pty. Ltd. v. Chief Secretary of New South Wales [1951] HCA 59; (1951) 84 CLR 442 The evidence does not prove that Mason was constrained by any action or threat of action to apply for the permits. The reasonable inference, as I have already said, is that payment was his own free choice. The plaintiffs had profitable orders or contracts for the carriage of goods to execute. They must be taken to have regarded the fees to be paid for permits as a normal expense of the business. Accordingly, they arranged to cover the fees as far as possible by the price they charged. They paid the charges for fees under business necessity to enable them to proceed with their orders and contracts for the carriage of goods inter-State. It is not a reasonable conclusion that having arranged to obtain from their customers money with which to pay for permits they were coerced into applying it to pay for permits. In my opinion, there is no evidence which satisfies me that Mason paid any of these sums of money under duress or compulsion of any kind. There is no evidence that he was subjected to any such constraint or pressure, and that in order to enable the inter-State carrying business to be carried on without interference his only reasonable alternative was to pay and to protest against payment in order to save the plaintiffs' rights. Upon the sum of the evidence the circumstances are comparable with those in Werrin's Case [1938] HCA 3; (1938) 59 CLR 150 The plaintiff in that case alleged that he was compelled by pressure and duress to pay an amount of sales tax on second-hand goods. He brought the action in consequence of a decision of this Court that second-hand goods were not within the scope of the Sales Tax Acts as they then stood. The case stated found that the Commissioner of Taxation had written to the plaintiff informing him that the amount of tax in question was payable under the Sales Tax Acts and that it "must be paid". According to that case stated the plaintiff there paid with reluctance. In that case there was an express demand to pay sent with the apparent force of the Acts behind it and the plaintiff paid with reluctance. In the present case, however, there is no evidence of any express demand to pay any amount sued for; on the contrary, payment is shown to have been made on the initiative of Mason, albeit under protest. In Werrin's Case [1938] HCA 3; (1938) 59 CLR 150 Latham C.J. and I were of the opinion that the facts were not sufficient to prove that the amount of sales tax was not paid voluntarily. In my opinion the reasons for that opinion apply here, for in my view, despite all the detail in Mason's evidence, it proves only that the sums of money in question were collected by the defendant upon the supposed authority of a statute when actually, according to the subsequent decision of the Privy Council, no authority existed. I think it is appropriate to quote here a passage from the judgment of Skerrett C.J. in Julian v. Auckland Corporation (1927) NZLR 453: "I decide it upon the simple proposition, which appears to be well established, that where money is paid at a time when the law is in favour of the payee it cannot be recovered by reason of a subsequent judicial decision reversing the former understanding of the law: see Henderson v. Folkestone Waterworks Co. (1885) 1 TLR 329" (1927) NZLR, at p 458 A statement of Gibbs J. in Brisbane v. Dacres [1813] EngR 486; (1813) 5 Taunt 143 (128 ER 641) is important and relevant here: "We must take this payment to have been made under a demand of right, and I think that where a man demands money of another as a matter of right, and that other, with a full knowledge of the facts upon which the demand is founded, has paid a sum, he never can recover back the sum he has so voluntarily paid. It may be, that upon a further view he may form a different opinion of the law, and it may be, his subsequent opinion may be the correct one. If we were to hold otherwise, I think many inconveniences may arise; there are many doubtful questions of law: when they arise, the defendant has an option, either to litigate the question, or to submit to the demand, and pay the money. I think, that by submitting to the demand, he that pays the money gives it to the person to whom he pays it, and makes it his, and closes the transaction between them. He who receives it has a right to consider it as his without dispute: he spends it in confidence that it is his; and it would be most mischievous and unjust, if he who has acquiesced in the right by such voluntary payment, should be at liberty, at any time within the statute of limitations, to rip up the matter, and recover back the money. He who received it is not in the same condition: he has spent it in the confidence it was his, and perhaps has no means of repayment" (1813) 5 Taunt, at pp 152, 153 (128 ER, at p 645) There is no satisfactory evidence that any of the sums was paid under any duress, express or implied. It is therefore not established that the defendant received any of these amounts to the use of the plaintiffs. I would dismiss the action. (at p123)

I did not agree that a writ of habeas corpus should issue. (at p39) 
2. It appeared that the Sheriff of the Australian Capital Territory had sent the applicant, after he was sentenced by the Supreme Court at Canberra, to the prison in New South Wales under a transmission warrant signed by the Sheriff. The prison was, under s. 120 of the Constitution, a place where the applicant could be lawfully detained as punishment for the offences of which the Supreme Court convicted him. The committal of the applicant to the custody of the authorties at the prison was within the authority of the Sheriff under ss. 36 and 37 of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933-1966 (Cth). It was not necessary for the Supreme Court to authorize, by any warrant of its own, the committal of the applicant to a prison in New South Wales. The order of the Supreme Court that the applicant serve a term of imprisonment, together with s. 120, was sufficient authority for the action taken by the Sheriff after sentence. As regards the need of further authority from the Supreme Court in addition to its order, I think that the dicta in R. v. Lydford (1914) 2 KB 378, at p 385 and in Williamson v. Inspector-General of Penal Establishments (1958) VR 330, at p 334, should lead reasonably to the conclusion that no such further authority was needed. I am unable to draw from the provisions of the Removal of Prisoners (Territories) Act 1923-1962 (Cth) that it was any part of the legislative intention to abrogate the authority of the Sheriff under ss. 36 and 37 to execute an order o imprisonment made by the Supreme Court. This I think is the real obstacle to the issue of a writ of habeas corpus in this case. (at p40)

    In my opinion the order nisi should be discharged.

2. The Commissioner decided in the matters to which the order nisi refers that employees engaged in the production, delivery and sampling of ready-mixed concrete at batching plants "off-site" are eligible for membership of the Australian Builders' Labourers' Federation. The Commissioner decided this after consideration of rules of the federation and the scope of its registration as an organization - it is registered as an association of employees "in and in connexion with the building industry". I think the question of the capacity of this organization to represent the industrial interests of any employee is properly one for the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to determine, and it is not necessary for this Court to decide the question in this case: R. v. Hickman; Ex parte Fox and Clinton, per Dixon J. [1945] HCA 53; (1945) 70 CLR 598, at pp 613-614 and R. v. Portus; Ex parte Federated Clerks Union of Australia, per Latham C.J. [1949] HCA 53; (1949) 79 CLR 428, at p 433 . (at p80)

3. The Commissioner has jurisdiction under the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1970 (Cth) relating to the powers and functions of a Commissioner, to entertain the matters to which the order nisi refers and, if he thinks fit, to make an award in each of them. Jurisdiction to make an award is conferred on a Commissioner by s. 33 (2) of this Act. The jurisdiction is arbitral. This is not a reason for denying that the commission or a Commissioner may determine the meaning of "in and in connexion with the building industry", or the connotation of the term "labourer" in the federation's rules. An observation in the case of R. v. Hickman; Ex parte Fox and Clinton (1945) 70 CLR, at p 614 is in point:

    "From a practical point of view, the application of the
    Regulations" (then in question) "should be determined
    according to some industrial principle or policy and not
    according to the legal rules of construction and the analytical
    reasoning upon which the decision of a court of law must rest." (at p80)

4. Registration of an association of employees under this Act, as an organization in or in connexion with an industry, has not a limiting effect on membership analogous to that of the memorandum of association of a trading company on its objects: Reg. v. Dunlop Rubber Australia Ltd.; Ex parte Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia [1957] HCA 19; (1957) 97 CLR 71, at p 72 . The Commissioner, in fact, determined the connotation of "labourer" by taking into account what he considered is established by usage. Section 25 of the Act says: "Each member of the Commission shall keep himself acquainted with industrial affairs and conditions". I take the view that under the provisions of this Act relating to the powers and functions of the commission that the capacity of an "organization" to represent the industrial interests of employees for whom it is claiming an award in the commission, is a question to be adjudicated upon by the Commissioner in determining whether there is an industrial dispute. The question is not extrinsic to the jurisdiction possessed by the Commissioner. It follows that there is no matter of prohibition and prohibition will not lie (Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty. Ltd. v. Whyte (1938) [1938] HCA 7; 59 CLR 369 ; Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, Australian District v. Haberfield Pty. Ltd. [1907] HCA 37; (1907) 5 CLR 33 ). (at p81)

5. Counsel for the federation criticized the locus standi of the prosecutor. I reserve for future consideration the points which he raised if that be necessary. (at p81)

The appellant, who was not an employer, was convicted of a contravention of sec. 16 (1) (b) of the Special Income and Wages Tax (Management) Act 1933-1934 and fined. Sec. 16, which was enacted "with regard to the tax payable upon income from wages," imposes a number of obligations upon "every employer," and under that name he is made liable upon summary conviction to a penalty or upon conviction on indictment to imprisonment. Sub-sec. 8, which attaches these sanctions to what is commanded by the section, concludes by empowering the court to order the defaulting employer to pay the amount of the tax or any fine certified by the commissioner to be unpaid or both the tax and the fine in addition to imposing punishment.

Briefly stated the obligations of "every employer" under sec. 16 include the following: first, to collect from his employees the amount of the wages tax for which they are liable on their incomes from wages (sec. 16 (1) (a)), secondly, to record all payments made by him to his employees (sec. 16 (1) (b) (i)), thirdly, where his employees are not less than a specified number, to pay to the Commissioner of Taxation the amount of tax payable on the wages paid to the employees (sec. 16 (1) (b) (ii)).

The appellant was the public officer of a company which defaulted in its obligations as an employer under sec. 16 (1) (b) (ii). He was charged and convicted upon the assumption that, as the public officer of the company, he was liable to pay to the Commissioner of Taxation the amount of wages tax owing by the company.

The Special Income and Wages Tax (Management) Act 1933-1934 under which the appellant was convicted contains no independent provisions for the appointment of a public officer or the definition of his duties. But sec. 78 of the Income Tax (Management) Act 1928, as amended, provides for the representation by a public officer of every company which derives income. This section is one of the provisions of the Income Tax (Management) Act 1928, which sec. 15 (1) of the Special Income and Wages Tax (Management) Act 1933-1934 enacts "shall be applicable to the tax as if such taxes were the income tax under the principal Act." The tax means the special income tax or wages tax and the principal Act means the Income Tax (Management) Act 1928. Sec. 78 (e) is in the following terms: "Without prejudice to the liability of the company, the public officer shall be liable for the doing of all such things as are required to be done by or on behalf of the company under this Act or the regulations in force thereunder, and in case of default in doing any of such things, shall be liable for all penalties imposed for any breach of the provisions of this Act or such regulations, and the company, as well as such public officer, shall also be liable for such penalties." The liability of the public officer of a company under these provisions does not extend beyond the things which the company is required to do as a taxpayer under the Act. But sec. 16 (1) (b) (ii) of the Special Income and Wages Tax (Management) Act 1933-1934 does not impose any liability on the employer as a taxpayer. In the case of wages tax the taxpayer is the employee from whom the employer is bound to collect the amount of wages tax which, under sec. 16 (1) (b) (ii), he is liable to pay to the Commissioner of Taxation. If that tax were income tax under the principal Act, which is the assumption which has to be made, it would not be the company's income tax but the income tax of its employees, and it is clear that the public officer would not be under any liability, even upon the widest possible construction of sec. 78 (e) of the Income Tax (Management) Act 1928, to pay any income tax except that to which the company was assessed under the Act. As the application of sec. 78 (e) to wages tax is limited by the assumption expressed in sec. 15 (1) of the Special Income and Wages Tax (Management) Act 1933-1934 it may not be applied so as to impose on a public officer a liability in respect of wages tax wider than that to which these provisions might expose him if that tax were actually income tax and to bind him to pay the wages tax of the employees of the company which he represents.

For these reasons I think that the conviction was wrong. It is not material to the steps by which this conclusion has been reached to decide whether sec. 78 (e) of the Income Tax (Management) Act 1928 imposes a liability on the public officer personally to pay the income tax at which the company which he represents has been assessed. The basis of the conclusion is that, whatever be the precise list of things which sec. 78 (e) makes the public officer liable to do, those provisions do not make him liable to pay the income tax of any taxpayer other than the company. Hence these provisions cannot, consistently with the assumption upon which they are applicable, apply so as to render the public officer of a company liable for failure to discharge its obligations under sec. 16 (1) (b) (ii) of the Special Income and Wages Tax (Management) Act 1933-1934. I agree, however, that the language of sec. 78 (e) of the Income Tax (Management) Act 1928 is not sufficiently clear to impose a liability on the public officer to pay the company's own income tax or to expose him to fine or imprisonment if it is not paid.

The appeal should be allowed, the rule nisi for statutory prohibition made absolute, and the appellant's costs here and below paid by the responden

n my opinion this appeal involves no question of law and is concerned only with a very special set of facts raising a problem of judicial discretion. The judicial discretion is committed to the Supreme Court but this Court has jurisdiction upon an appeal by special leave to review the decision of that Court if we think the discretion has not been soundly exercised. I was not able to agree in the order granting special leave to appeal from the order of the Supreme Court because I thought that the matter was not of a description falling within the principles upon which we exercise our power of giving special leave. But special leave being granted, the question is simply whether we should be satisfied of the unsoundness of the conclusion of the Full Court of the Supreme Court. The very fact that the parentage of the two children has been the subject of litigious proceedings is itself a misfortune for both of them and I think that it will be in the future interests of both of them if in disposing of the appeal we confine our reasons to a bare statement of the essential steps leading to the conclusion. (at p641)

2. I am not satisfied that the view taken of the case in the Full Court of the Supreme Court is unsound. The closely-reasoned judgment of Fullagar J. appears to me to be quite satisfactory and I think that in all substantial respects it has withstood the criticism to which it was subjected. Herring C.J. and Lowe J. expressed their agreement with the views of Fullagar J. I cannot however, concur in the first ground given by Herring C.J., namely, that the proceedings were inappropriate and that unless all possible doubt were excluded the Court should require a decision in rem as to parentage before it decided upon any change of custody based solely on the parentage of the child. This ground must, I think, be attributable to a mistaken supposition that the provisions of the Legitimacy Declaration Act 1858 have been transcribed in Victoria. (at p641)

3. In deciding a question as to the custody of an infant the Court is bound by statute to regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration. In ordinary circumstances an infant's welfare is best consulted by being placed under the care and control of his or her parents. We all take it for granted and the courts in dealing with infants proceed from that presumptive position. In the present case, however, the child Nola has from birth been accepted by Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins as their own offspring. She is now over four years of age and has been reared as one of their children. They have never doubted that she is their child and she has of course never doubted that they are her parents. At present her life and happiness are bound up with her membership of the family, with the sisterly and brotherly affection of the other children and the parental affection of Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins. Nothing that has happened in the course of the litigation seems to have shaken Mrs. Jenkin's conviction that Nola is her child. If therefore she is left in the custody of Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins Nola will be brought up by those who suppose that she is their child and, it may be added, by estimable people and in conditions of comfort. It is manifest that if she is to be torn by judicial decree from this family life it can only be for a very strong reason which is regarded as forming an overriding consideration decisive of her more lasting welfare. The reason assigned is that however strong may be the conviction of Mrs. Jenkins to the contrary Nola is in truth the child of Mr. and Mrs. Morrison but by some tragic mistake committed at the Kyneton Hospital was given to Mrs. Jenkins, instead of her own child, immediately or soon after each woman had given birth to a daughter. (at p642)

4. Now the foundation of the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court is that before, on such a ground, the Court overturns the existing state of things and takes Nola from the Jenkins and entrusts her custody to the Morrisons, it should be completely assured that it is true. Unless the proofs exclude all real doubt and risk of error in the conclusion, Nola should be left with those who have brought her up in the confident belief that she is their daughter. (at p642)

5. This view of the Full Court appears to me to be clearly sound. The whole future happiness and welfare of the child is at stake. Not only is her happiness and welfare involved, but so is that of the other child, Johanne Lee, whom the Morrisons have hitherto brought up as their child. What is to happen to her if the Court were to transfer the custody of Nola to the Morrisons does not appear. The Jenkins of course repudiate her as their child and could not be required to receive her into their family. It would militate against Nola's future happiness and welfare if the transfer were made notwithstanding the continued existence of reasonable cause for doubt as to the child's parentage and it would be little short of disastrous if afterwards further information made it appear more likely that after all the Jenkins were her parents. The inference that Nola is the child of the Morrisons rests of course wholly on circumstantial evidence. Notwithstanding the wealth of detail gone into, particularly as to the circumstances of the birth of the two children, the whole case depends upon a chain consisting of a very few evidentiary facts or circumstances and some steps in reasoning which together are relied upon as warranting the inference. The first of these facts or steps is the conclusion deposed to by scientific witnesses that Johanne Lee belongs to a blood group that is inconsistent with her being the child of Mr. Morrison. This conclusion the Jenkins are powerless to deny. The second step is the inference that she is therefore not the child of Mrs. Morrison. Any other inference would reflect upon Mrs. Morrison and the Jenkins make no such reflection. The third is the fact that from the time that Mrs. Morrison left the hospital with a girl child and until the scientists took the blood tests there has been no change in the identity of that child and she is Johanne Lee and was the child submitted to the blood tests. This fact is proved by the Morrisons. Nothing of course could be more probable and it may be accepted as possessing as much certainty as attaches to the proof of any fact in human affairs. But as it is an essential step in the reasoning it must not be omitted. The fourth step is proof that at the hospital where both women were confined there was a real chance of confusion between the female child which Mrs. Morrison bore and some other female child. The fifth step is the elimination of the possibility that any other child but Mrs. Jenkins' could have been attributed to Mrs. Morrison. The sixth step is the inference that correspondingly Mrs. Jenkins must have received Mrs. Morrison's child. (at p643)

6. By this chain of reasoning the result that Nola is Mrs. Morrison's child is said to be established. To make good the last three steps a great deal of evidence was adduced at the hearing. The events of the morning of 22nd June 1945 when both women were delivered of female children within ten or fifteen minutes in the same labour ward were inquired into in great detail. I should have thought that neither nurses nor patients could be expected to observe or recall so much and that their attempts to reconstruct the incidents of the morning could not safely be relied upon. But two conclusions emerge which are clear enough. One is that there was no routine for identifying babies which excluded the possibility of mistake and the other is that because two women were delivered by the same doctor and nursing staff in the same ward within such a short time there was a greater liability to confusion. (at p643)

7. But in my opinion the further inference or conclusions which have been drawn as to the precise manner in which the babies were handled and exactly by whom are doubtful and in some respects speculative and they are unsafe. (at p643)

8. Two other recently born female children were in the hospital, one born on 20th and the other on 19th of June. It does not appear whether they were full-time children nor was the condition of the mothers or any other circumstances proved really relevant to the possibility or impossibility, likelihood or unlikelihood, of the confusion (if one took place) being with either of those children. The case for the Morrisons naturally was that their child was confused with the Jenkins' child immediately after the birth of the children. That was the view which Barry J. adopted and acted upon. But Mrs. Morrison's mother, who visited the hospital later on the same day, in the afternoon, said that she was shown a child as her daughter's which was not the child her daughter brought home from the hospital. The tendency of her evidence if it were correct was to show a confusion at some later time and not as a result of the birth of two children at nearly the same time in the same ward. There would therefore be little or no reason to suppose that the confusion was with Mrs. Jenkins' child rather than with one of the other two girl babies. (at p644)

9. The only further fact I shall mention is that little or nothing is known concerning the blood grouping of the Jenkins and Nola. They submitted themselves to their medical adviser for a blood test and he reported that it disclosed that Nola might be their child, that is that their blood grouping was consistent with their being the parents of Nola. He made an affidavit to that effect but he was abroad and not available for cross-examination. The Jenkins declined to submit themselves and the child to further blood tests. (at p644)

10. I shall not go into the question of when and why the Morrisons began to doubt that Johanne Lee was their child and how their claim to Nola originated and came to be litigated. No doubt every element in the case has a bearing upon the exercise of the Court's discretion in determining whether Nola should be transferred to Mr. and Mrs. Morrison's custody. But the Supreme Court has dealt sufficiently with these additional matters. To my mind the chief issue is whether the chain of fact and of reasoning I have briefly set out establishes the inference that Nola is the child of Mr. and Mrs. Morrison with such a high degree of certainty that the Court should give effect to their claims at the expense of the considerations which otherwise would make it imperative for the child's welfare that she continue as a member of the Jenkins family. (at p644)

11. In my opinion this issue was properly decided in the negative by the Full Court of the Supreme Court. (at p644)

12. With any chain of circumstantial evidence the chances of error in the conclusion arise first from the chances of error in each fact or consideration forming the steps and second from the chance of error in reasoning to the conclusion from the whole of those facts and considerations. It is therefore wrong to take each fact or consideration separately, to assess the possibilities of error in finding it is established and then if you think it should be found afterwards to treat it as a certainty and pass to the next fact or consideration and so on to the conclusion. The possibilities of error at all points must be combined and assessed together. (at p644)

13. In the present case I think that when all the possibilities are taken into account there is too much uncertainty in the inference that Nola is the child of Mr. and Mrs. Morrison to warrant an order taking her from Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins and placing her in the custody of Mr. and Mrs. Morrison. It was a sound exercise of the discretion of the Supreme Court to leave her in the custody of Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins. (at p645)

14. I do not think that we should interfere with the order of the Full Court of the Supreme Court as to costs. (at p645)

15. In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs. (at p645)

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

The question for decision is whether upon the true construction of the residuary gift any child of the testator's brother Michael or of his sister Margaret, who died without issue before the period of distribution, took an interest which was transmissible to the personal representative of such child. The residuary gift is expressed to depend on a future contingency which is in these terms: "in case of the death of all my children without leaving issue under the trusts of my will and codicil." The contingency is one which is irrespective of the nephews and nieces surviving the given period. "As far as I can discover," Kay J. said in In re Cresswell; Parkin v. Cresswell[25], "the only case in which a contingent future interest is not transmissible is where the being in existence when the contingency happens is an essential part of the description of the person who is to take." The contingency here is a collateral event, and the observations of that learned judge apply. The residuary gift begins in this way: "I declare that in case of the death and failure of issue of my said children as aforesaid all the residue and remainder of my real and personal estate ... shall be equally divided amongst the children of my brother Michael ... and of my sister Margaret." The presumption which would arise from these words is that the testator did intend that the nephews and nieces should be entitled in interest when the will and codicils took effect but not in possession until the period of distribution; and, accordingly, these words would then let in the personal representative of any nephew or niece dying before such period, as such nephew or niece would have taken a transmissible interest.

Does the following part of the gift contain a contrary intention to which the presumption must yield? The words which follow, "and the issue of any such children of my said last-mentioned brother and sister who shall be dead," clearly refer to a nephew or niece dying leaving issue. They are not capable in themselves of divesting the interest of any nephew or niece who died without issue. The concluding part of the gift is as follows: "provided nevertheless that the issue of any deceased child of my said last-mentioned brother and sister shall have no more than the share to which the deceased child or respective deceased children would have been entitled to if living per stirpes and not per capita." These words govern the quantum of interest to be taken by the issue of a deceased nephew or niece but they are not necessarily capable in themselves of divesting the interest of any nephew or niece who died without issue.

It is contended on behalf of the appellants that redundancy of expression should not be attributed to the testator and that the words, "would have been entitled to if living," show that the testator did not contemplate that those nephews and nieces who did not survive the period of distribution would be entitled to any interest whatever. The alternative constructions are either to hold that a redundancy was not intended, although one might appear from the words, or to imply in the residuary gift an additional contingency that would result in the exclusion from the class of the presumptive objects of the gift of nephews and nieces who were alive at his death but who died without issue before the period of distribution. The more natural, and, in my opinion, the correct construction is to admit the redundancy rather than to imply another contingency besides that upon which the gift is expressed to be dependent.

This conclusion is quite consistent with the testator's obvious plan of adding to his testamentary dispositions in order to avoid an intestacy. If it was his intention to make the residuary gift dependent on a contingency which would exclude all nephews and nieces dying without issue before the period of distribution, it does not appear that he would have eliminated the possibility of an intestacy arising. For all his nephews and nieces might have died before the period of distribution without leaving issue.

 I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. Under the Theatres and Public Halls Act 1908-1946, with very limited exceptions, it is not lawful to exhibit moving pictures in a public hall unless in a hall in respect of which two forms of licence have been obtained. The first is a licence for the use of the hall for what may be described as public entertainment. The second is an endorsement on the licence specifically authorizing the use of the hall for the exhibition of films. The Act is one which has grown up by a process of amendment and in such cases it is not always easy to make every provision fit into a perfectly logical and coherent legislative picture so that the whole instrument is made consistent by a process of interpretation. (at p193)

2. Attempting the task of construing the provisions of the Act as best I can, after studying it as a whole I have reached two conclusions as to its meaning and they go to the essence of this case. The first is that the Act does not intend that a licence may be obtained except by the owner of a hall or the lessee of a hall. The second is that the endorsement may not be obtained except by a person in whose name the licence is expressed. The justification for the view that a licence can only be obtained by the owner or a lessee lies in s. 9 (1) (a) and s. 13. Section 9 (1) (a) says that on application made as prescribed by the owner or lessee of a theatre or public hall or any person duly authorized by such owner or lessee the Minister may issue a licence. Section 13, which deals with the transfer of licences, provides that every transfer shall be to an owner or lessee of the building licensed. The words in s. 9 "or any person duly authorized by such owner or lessee" were introduced by the Act of 1946. They appear to me to mean "authorized to apply for a licence on behalf of the owner or lessee" and not to enable a person who otherwise may be a stranger to the building to obtain a licence in his own name. (at p193)

3. The provisions which relate to the endorsement, when they are read together, appear to make it quite plain that only the licensee could obtain the endorsement. In the present case a licence subsisted in the Broken Hill City Council for the hall which is under consideration, but unfortunately a transfer was attempted to the now appellant at a time when he had no title either as owner or lessee of the building. He was merely a prospective lessee, with perhaps some assurance that, subject to agreement on details, he might eventually become a lessee. The transfer was, in my opinion, ineffectual and the licence remained in the Broken Hill City Council. It was ineffectual because the transfer is prohibited by s. 13 of the Act. The City Council did not take steps to renew the licence. The appellant in the result did take steps to renew the licence, but, as he was not the original licensee and could not then lawfully acquire the original licence by transfer, his attempts to renew it were in law rendered nugatory. While he regarded himself as a transferee of the licence he applied for an endorsement of the licence for the purpose of exhibiting films. His application was incompetent because he was not in law the licensee. Moreover, as he was neither the owner nor a lessee of the hall at that date, he was not qualified to become a licensee. (at p194)

4. His application, however, was referred by the Minister to the Theatres and Films Commission. That fact is not clearly stated in the affidavit, but we must take it to be so, otherwise the proceedings would have commenced with a fundamental irregularity. The commission refused the application, though on what grounds we do not know. When the commission refuses an application s. 13D (11) gives an appeal from the refusal to the District Court and provides that the provisions of the District Courts Act shall apply to and in respect of the appeal with such modifications as may be necessary to give effect to the sub-section. The appellant attempted to appeal. But by that date there was no existing licence at all. He subsequently obtained a de-facto licence by way of renewal. But in contemplation of law he had never been the licensee. He could not in my opinion take the necessary steps under s. 13D, which would result in a reference by the Minister to the commission. The application was incompetent from the inception. Section 13D did not, therefore, give an appeal to the District Court from the refusal. It could not do so because the application to the Minister did not fall within the section. For s. 13D (1) limits the application of the whole section to applications within the categories it sets out. The relevant category is s. 13D (1) (b) and in my opinion it does not include a licence that is invalidly issued or transferred or an application that is incompetent. The District Court, however, entertained the appeal and granted the endorsement. The grant of the endorsement by the District Court is attacked by certiorari. The majority of the Supreme Court has issued the certiorari to bring up the order of the District Court and quash it. In my opinion, the decision of the majority to issue a certiorari was correct. The objections which have been made on the part of the appellant to the issue of certiorari include grounds which are necessarily negatived by the conclusions I have already stated. It is, however, contended that it is enough that an application for endorsement should be made de facto by a person holding a licence de facto. If such an application is referred to the commission the power of the commission to decide the application attaches and from its decision an appeal lies. The contention depends on the construction of s. 13D (1) (b). Section 13D (1) provides that the section shall apply only to the applications set out, and par. (b) is concerned with an application for the prescribed endorsement on a licence issued under the part and current at the date of the application. (at p195)

5. I consider that the words "application for the prescribed endorsement on the licence" require an application which is competent under the other provisions of the Act for an endorsement upon a licence validly issued and, if transferred, validly transferred. They are not satisfied by a mere de-facto application with respect to a mere de-facto licence. The reason for that construction is that sub-s. (1) of the section is very clear in limiting the application of the section which gives a reference to the commission and a subsequent appeal to the District Court to specific categories of applications, and it can hardly mean an application which is not lawful under the various sections to which it has implied reference. (at p195)

6. Accordingly, the Minister was never in a position lawfully to refer the matter to the commission, the commission had no lawful jurisdiction to grant the application, and the District Court could not, in its turn, obtain jurisdiction over an appeal from the commission's refusal of the application. Section 51 of the District Courts Act contains a provision protecting orders of the District Court from a writ of certiorari and, if s. 13D (11) (d) of the Theatres and Public Halls Act applied, it might well be that the provisions of s. 51 of the District Courts Act would operate in this particular case and so protect the order now challenged. But the application of sub-s. (11) (d) at all is contingent upon the case coming within s. 13D (1) (b). (at p195)

7. I am unable to give to sub-s. (11) of s. 13D the construction which is claimed by the appellant, namely, that it enables the District Court to deal with an appeal arising out of any application that is referred independently of its legality or competence and to decide whether it is an authorized one or not. It appears to me that sub-s. (1) is designed to limit the operation of the whole section to authorized applications of the required description. If they fall outside the required description or are not authorized by the legislation, then they fall outside the whole of the provisions of s. 13D, including sub-s. (11). That means that they fall outside par. (d) of sub-s. (11), which alone could incorporate s. 51 of the District Courts Act and so give protection against certiorari. There is, in my opinion, no statutory protection against certiorari in such a case as this. (at p196)

8. It was suggested further that perhaps certiorari would not lie to the District Court exercising this particular jurisdiction or power because it is a jurisdiction or power rather of an administrative or executive nature than of a judicial nature. It is no doubt an appeal from an administrative tribunal or body, but the purpose of the statute is to remove the question whether an endorsement on a licence is to be refused or granted on specific grounds and transfer it from the ordinary administrative process to a judicial tribunal to investigate judicially. It is a typical case falling within the province of certiorari as certiorari has been applied in more recent times. (at p196)

9. It is, I think, enough to refer to some of the late cases, particularly to R. v. Hendon Rural District Council; Ex parte Chorley (1933) 2 KB 696 ; R. v. Boycott; Ex parte Keasley (1939) 2 KB 651 and R. v. Milk Marketing Board; Ex parte North (1934) 50 TLR 559 . (at p196)

10. For these reasons, I am of the opinion that certiorari was properly granted. Jordan C.J. thought that perhaps subsequent events might be taken into account by the District Court judge, and he might, so to speak, resume the matter as at a subsequent date and base his decision on the set of facts as they presented themselves at the time when he actually gave his decision. The affidavit is not at all clear, but it would seem that before the actual decision of the District Court the applicant had got a subsisting licence in his name granted after he had become lessee of the building. The two conditions which must concur to enable him to apply for an endorsement would thus exist at the date of the actual decision of the District Court though not at the time the District Court judge reserved his decision. (at p196)

11. But I think that the construction which I have given to s. 13D (1) and (3) means that, unless there was a valid initial application and a valid reference which fell within those provisions there was nothing for the commission or for the District Court to deal with. On the frame of this statute it does not seem to me to be possible to give effect to the doctrine which Jordan C.J. had in mind, namely that, where a tribunal has jurisdiction by way of rehearing in the fullest sense, it may take into account the law and the facts as they exist at the time of its decision and base its decision upon them. To apply this doctrine in the present case would be like dispensing with the necessity in ordinary litigation of the existence of a cause of action at the date of the issue of the writ. (at p197)

12. For these reasons, I think that the appeal must be dismissed with costs. (at p197)

The substantial question in this case is whether the statute called The Police Acts 1937 to 1948 (Q.), the Act upon which this appeal depends, affects the power which the Crown enjoys at common law to dismiss at pleasure a member of the Police Force, appointed and holding office under that Act. By reason of s. 3(iii) the appellant is deemed to have been at all material times a member of the Police Force appointed and holding office under the provisions of the Act. According to the terms of a minute of the Executive Council at a meeting held on 5th January 1950 the Governor in Council approved of his appointment as a sub-inspector of police, in pursuance of the provisions of The Police Acts 1937 to 1948, and according to the terms of a minute of the Executive Council held on 15th February 1951 the Governor in Council approved of the dismissal of the appellant from the Police Force, in pursuance of the provisions of The Police Acts 1937 to 1948. Section 8 of the Act confers power upon the Governor in Council to appoint sub-inspectors and inspectors of police. That section read with ss. 3(1) and 25(1)(b) of The Acts Interpretation Act of 1954 (Q.), is a power not only to appoint such officers but also to remove them from office. Section 73 of The Police Acts provides that: "Save as is herein otherwise expressly provided nothing in this Act contained shall be taken to prevent any member of the Police Force from being discharged, dismissed, or otherwise removed from office in the same manner in all respects as if this Act had not been passed". The appellant referred to the second proviso of s. 10 as an express provision preventing the discharge, dismissal or removal of a constable by the Crown without complying with the conditions contained in that proviso. In order to bring himself within the operation of that express provision, the appellant contended that despite the minute of the Executive Council approving of his appointment to the rank of sub-inspector he never ceased to be a constable of police having the protection of that proviso. It is unnecessary to examine the question whether his appointment as sub-inspector was, as he contends, invalid or, if valid, did not take away his rights as a constable, because it is plain that the provision of the second proviso regulating the discharge or dismissal of a constable upon which he relies applies only to the Commissioner and does not affect the power of the Crown to discharge or dismiss a member of the Police Force at will, without complying with any such conditions as the provision in question imposes upon the Commissioner. (at p180)

2. Another contention advanced by the appellant was that the minute of the Executive Council was really an Order in Council and for that reason s. 75 of The Police Acts required it to be published in the Gazette and laid before the Legislative Assembly. However, the Court was not referred to any statutory provision requiring that the dismissal of a member of the Police Force by the Crown take place by Order in Council. The decision of the Governor in Council that the appellant be dismissed from the Police Force was in itself sufficient. According to the terms of the minute of the decision of the Executive Council, the dismissal of the appellant took effect from the time at which it was made. (at p180)

3. The appellant argued his appeal clearly and temperately. But I think that there is no substance in any of his contentions, and that the appeal should therefore be dismissed. (at p180)

I would answer the question submitted in the negative and can state my reasons very briefly. The clause in the testator's will that "it is my will and desire that the share in my trust estate of every daughter of mine . . . shall be by deed settled and assured" is not a mere power but an imperative trust which the trustees were bound to execute and they and not the deceased daughter executed the settlement pursuant to the provisions in the will.

This is an appeal by special leave from the Magistrates Court at Employees' Compensation Act 1930-1956. The appellant was badly injured in a motor accident on the evening of Thursday, 10th July 1958, as he drove from Amberley R.A.A.F. station or base to Brisbane. He claimed compensation under s. 9A of that Act. He was a leading aircraftsman of the R.A.A.F. quartered at the R.A.A.F. establishment at Amberley. His actual work was that of a motor transport fitter at No. 3 aircraft depot. The information before us about the camp or establishment, the manner in which it is commanded and administered, the orders and instructions as to leave and the theoretical as well as the practical duties of the appellant is indeed exiguous. It is said that the establishment is under command, but the personnel like Adcock were at liberty to go away from the "camp" outside hours when "on duty". Adcock usually worked as a fitter from 7.40 a.m. to 4.50 p.m., when he was stood down. He lived in the camp in a hut which he shared with another member of the Air Force. On Thursday, 10th July 1958, a film was advertised to be shown at the Temperance Hall, Brisbane, and he and a companion designed to see it, driving to Brisbane for the purpose in Adcock's own car. (at p197)

2. He was "stood down" at the usual time. There happened to be a car in the car park which needed some attention. It belonged to a friend who was ready to make, in respect of any work he did upon it, a contribution to the funds of a Church Young People's Group in which they were both interested. Adcock spent half an hour or so putting the car right. Then he had his meal, cleaned himself up at the hut and went off in civilian clothes upon his journey to Brisbane. On the road he met with an accident resulting in serious injuries. (at p197)

3. Section 9A (1) of the Act provides that where personal injury by accident is caused to an employee while he is travelling to or from (a) his employment by the Commonwealth; (b) . . . the Commonwealth shall, subject to the Act, be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the Act as if the accident were an accident arising out of or in the course of the employment. Sub-section (2) provides among other things that in the section "travelling" means travelling by the shortest convenient route for the journey. It will be noticed that there is no definition or description of the journey in terms of two termini - only "to or from the employment" - and it is difficult therefore to apply the expression "shortest convenient route". But doubtless it was supposed that every journey was commenced with an end in view. (at p197)

4. By s. 4A (2) it is provided that except as provided by the section the Act applies to, and in relation to, a member of the Defence Force. The exceptions are in the remaining sub-sections of s. 4A but they are not presently material. Further, the definition of "employee" in s. 4 (1) includes a member of the Defence Force to whom the Act applies. I see no reason myself why the appellant should not be considered an "employee" travelling from his employment by the Commonwealth when personal injury by accident was caused to him. It appears to me that the case falls within the words of the Act and that is enough. There is no reason why we should mould them to accord with what to some may seem more reasonable, still less restrict them. It is a much criticized piece of drafting and is certainly a difficult statute. Some of the consequences may not have been foreseen but at all events they appear to me to be within the intention expressed. In the application of s. 9A to the present case there are some points in which, rightly or wrongly, my opinion is more free from doubt than perhaps an opinion about the meaning and effect of anything contained in this notoriously contentious statutory text should be. (at p198)

5. In the first place I do not think that it is possible to read s. 9A (1) as referring to travelling to or from the employee's abode, dwelling or residence from or to his employment. It is not only because the words are not there and it would not be in accordance with the canons of interpretation to imply them or to import the notion or idea they connote. It is also because at one time the necessary words were in the provision and were actually taken out. This was done by Act No. 61 of 1948, s. 4, by which the version of s. 9A as it was introduced by Act No. 8 of 1944 was replaced. In the first version the expression was "travelling to or from work" and by sub-s. (2) that expression was to mean "travelling between the employee's place of abode and place of employment"; at the same time the expression was extended, artificially, to include travelling between those two places and technical schools and the like. Then by Act No. 27 of 1951, s. 4, the words "place of" were removed. (at p198)

6. The second matter about which I speak is this. I do not think that it is possible to reject the application of s. 9A to employees who live at their place of work or to refuse to give the provision a full operation with reference to their situation. It is unnecessary to say that in very many branches of Commonwealth civilian employment there are persons who would be affected by such a view and if one turns to the regulation giving the list of "Authorities of the Commonwealth" to which the Act applies by virtue of s. 22 it becomes apparent that there would be an even wider application of the limitation: see reg. 15 of the Employees' Compensation Regulations (1953, No. 22). (at p199)

7. The reason why I think such a limitation or modification is not possible is simply that it appears to me to be contrary to the language of s. 9A (1) which is quite general and therefore neither contemplates nor, as I would think, admits of any exception or qualification. (at p199)

8. It must be borne in mind that it is by Act No. 61 of 1948 (assented to on 6th December 1949 and commencing on 3rd January 1950) that servicemen were first brought within the Act. It was done by an amendment of the definition of "employee". Section 4A (2), directly applying the Act to a member of the Defence Force, was added by s. 3 of No. 27 of 1951. It is therefore correct to regard the question in the first instance not in relation to the armed services but from the point of view of civilian employees of the Commonwealth living at the place of employment, whether a lighthouse, a linesmen's camp or some more attractive abode. Moreover it must be remembered that not all Commonwealth ships are naval vessels. Once the question is settled as to how the enactment applies to civilian employees who live at or in connexion with the place where work is done or operations are carried on, the analogous application of the provisions to servicemen living in barracks, camps, service establishments, ships and so on seems to me to follow as a matter of course. (at p199)

9. The third thing to which I refer is that whatever may be the correct application of the expression "travelling to or from his employment" the word "employment", as it seems to me, must in that phrase as elsewhere include all the incidents of employment and cannot be limited to actual work. I think that it may be said with some confidence that whatever otherwise may be the operation of s. 9A it was intended that the potential right to compensation it confers upon the employee should attach where that given by s. 9 (1) ceases or ends; and that potential right does not cease to apply until the employee is outside the course of employment defined by reference to its incidents and adjuncts, to use a somewhat indefinite yet well-known expression. (at p199)

10. The difficulty of the case for me, however, is to know whether and how far the decision of the Court in The Commonwealth v. Wright [1956] HCA 79; (1956) 96 CLR 536 governs the outward journey commenced by the appellant Aircraftsman Adcock to Brisbane for the purpose of attending the exhibition of the moving picture. In Wright's Case [1956] HCA 79; (1956) 96 CLR 536 it was an inward journey to the Bandiana military camp by a soldier of the rank of private serving in the R.A.E.M.E. and attached to the workshops in the Receipt and Issue Section. His duties were in relation to checking up and logging trucks and tanks entering the workshops for repair. He went off duty on a Friday afternoon and was to have resumed duty on Monday morning. He lived at the camp which he had left, as he was at liberty to do, without a leave pass on Saturday morning, and was making his way back on foot to the camp on Saturday evening when he was killed by a passing car. A majority of the Court, Webb, Fullagar and Kitto JJ., held that when the accident occurred he was not "travelling to his employment by the Commonwealth" within the meaning of s. 9A (1). So far as s. 9A is concerned it was the opinion of Webb J. that "to support a claim for compensation the accident to a civilian employee must have arisen . . . when travelling . . . to or from a state of activity called 'employment' as distinct from the place where that activity takes place" (1). This, as I understand it, his Honour regarded as requiring in the case of a soldier the equivalent of "travelling . . . when going on leave from the camp or returning to the camp on the expiration of leave; but not otherwise for personal reasons" (1956) 96 CLR, at p 551 . The learned judge then expressed the ground of his decision in the following passage: "Such being, in my opinion, the effect of the legislation I revert to the facts to see whether they support the claim. I readily conclude that they do not, for the reasons that when the deceased was killed he might have been returning to the camp intending to eat or sleep there, and not to resume his duties but to continue on leave and to depart from the camp again and to return to it before Monday, as he was at liberty to do provided his leave was not cancelled and he did not go more than one hundred miles from the camp; or he might have been returning intending to terminate his leave and resume his military duties. There is no presumption in favour of an intention to resume his military duties, as there would be if he had been killed on the Sunday night when returning to the camp. Then one intention was as likely to have been entertained by the deceased as was the other, and so the claimant failed to discharge the onus of proof that rested on her, and her claim was rightly rejected . . ." (1). I do not think that the view upon which his Honour acted in Wright's Case [1956] HCA 79; (1956) 96 CLR 536 has any application to the situation of Adcock. (at p200)

11. He had formed the intention of going to the Temperance Hall in Brisbane earlier in the day of Thursday, 10th July 1958; he was at liberty to leave the camp, and was proceeding to go from the actual performance of his work to do the additional half-hour's work for his friend in putting his car in order, then to a meal and to his hut to clean up. After that he set off on his intended expedition. I do not know that there is anything in any of the judgments in Wright's Case [1956] HCA 79; (1956) 96 CLR 536 to fix the exact terminus a quo of the "travelling from his employment" of a serviceman who is an artificer quartered in a military, naval or air force establishment, but so far as the reasons of Webb J. are concerned the analogy would appear to lie in the hypothesis mentioned by his Honour of Wright's returning on Sunday evening in readiness for Monday morning and that favours the view that e converso Adcock was travelling from his employment. (at p201)

12. In the judgment of Fullagar J. the element of purpose is associated with "the duties of the employment" in terms which may be thought to involve a stricter or closer connexion. There are two passages extracts from which will suffice to make clear what was the view of the meaning of the expression "travelling to or from his employment" which his Honour adopted. The first is this : ". . . I think that there must be a real connexion between the journey and the employment in the sense that the immediate purpose of the employee in making the journey must be either to enter upon the duties which his employment imposes upon him or to absent himself temporarily from those duties" (1956) 96 CLR, at p 552 . The second passage is as follows : "A man cannot, in my opinion, be properly said to be travelling to his employment unless the purpose of his travelling is to assume the duties of his employment. The notion of travelling from employment is perhaps a little more difficult, for the reason that it is more natural to characterize a journey by reference to its point of destination than by reference to its point of departure. But a man cannot, in my opinion, properly be said to be travelling from his employment unless the occasion of his journey is the cessation for the time being of the duties of his employment and his primary purpose is to leave those duties behind him" (1956) 96 CLR, at p 553 . Had there been some means of showing that the purpose with which the deceased soldier in Wright's Case [1956] HCA 79; (1956) 96 CLR 536 set out on his return to camp was to await his return to actual work on Monday it seems that Fullagar J. would have admitted the possibility of his fulfilling the test stated in the foregoing extract. For his Honour said in a passage too long to quote in full - "It is not made to appear that his immediate purpose in going to the camp was to enter upon the duties of his employment" (1956) 96 CLR, at p 554 . After referring to the existence of a slightly higher degree of probability that the soldier had intended to sleep in camp, Fullagar J. proceeded : "But, whether or not our ignorance is unfortunate, we simply do not know what his purpose was in going to the camp. And, unless it is proved that his purpose was to resume the duties of his employment (which I think, on the whole, improbable) compensation is not, in my opinion, payable. The case may from one point of view seem a hard one, but I am unable to say that it falls within s. 9A" (1956) 96 CLR, at p 554 . Now, when his Honour speaks of the purpose of entering upon the duties of his employment, that I take to mean "in order that the employee should be in readiness for his duties". If the intervention had been contemplated of Sunday as a day of repose for him in camp I take it that would have satisfied the test. Correspondingly, I do not understand that the motive for departure from camp must be the immediate escape from the scene of labour. What seems to be contemplated is that the cessation of the soldier's labours (and of course the fact of his being entitled to leave, whether particular or as in the case of the deceased in Wright's Case [1956] HCA 79; (1956) 96 CLR 536 general) shall be the occasion of his departure from his "employment". It is obvious that when s. 9A (1) provides for travelling from the employment it is referring as a typical case to the cessation of the hours of labour as a reason for departure. But it can only be a typical case. Kitto J. alone adopts as a ground for his decision the view that the terminus ad quem in the case of the outward journey "from the employment" must be the abode or residence. In that view with great respect I differ from his Honour and I think that I am at liberty to do so. The second reason given by Kitto J. is that there was "simply nothing in the proved facts from which it can be thought more probable than not that his" (the soldier's) "purpose in making the journey to the camp was to get to his duties" (1956) 96 CLR, at p 559 . But his Honour said : "If the deceased soldier in the present case had been killed on the Sunday night instead of the Saturday night, it might have been inferred from circumstances that when the car struck him he was in the course of returning from his week-end leave in order to take up his duties at 7.30 on the following morning ; and accordingly his journey might have been described as a journey to his employment, notwithstanding that in the normal course it would bring him to the camp earlier than was strictly necessary" (1956) 96 CLR, at p 559 . One would suppose that if the soldier had returned to camp to sleep and be ready for work in the morning then it would be right to say that he had "travelled to his employment". But that appears to me a good reason for saying that if he ate a meal and cleaned himself up before leaving for Brisbane he was none the less "travelling from his employment". (at p203)

13. For the reasons that I have given I do not think that the decision of the majority of the Court in Wright's Case [1956] HCA 79; (1956) 96 CLR 536 when properly understood is in any way opposed to the conclusion that Adcock was travelling from his employment when he was injured. That conclusion I base upon the simple ground that whatever may be considered to be his employment at the Amberley R.A.A.F. establishment he was travelling from it to Brisbane when he was injured even if his employment consisted of his actual work as a motor transport fitter ; what he did before leaving the R.A.A.F. establishment in his car formed only reasonable incidents before or in preparation for his departure. (at p203)

14. Of course left to myself I would say for reasons which can be sufficiently inferred from what I wrote in Wright's Case (1) that he did not commence to travel from his employment until his car emerged from the R.A.A.F. establishment. But whenever the "journey" or departure from his employment should be regarded as commencing I am unable to see that he was not travelling from his employment when the personal injury by accident befell him for which he seeks to recover compensation. (at p203)

15. I would allow the appeal from the order of the magistrates court which dismissed his appeal from the rejection of his claim by the Delegate of the Commissioner of Employees' Compensation. (at p203)

The question which by this appeal the Commissioner of Stamp deceased person named Leslie Ross Gale within three years of his death, and therefore forming part of his notional estate for the purpose of the assessment and payment of death duty, should be regarded as a money sum or an interest in real property. (at p104)

2. The question arises under s. 102 (2) (b) of the Stamp Duties Act 1920-1949 (N.S.W.). The material part of that provision says that for the purpose of the assessment and payment of death duty . . . the estate of a deceased person shall be deemed to include and consist of the following classes of property: - ". . . 2 (b) Any property comprised in any gift made by the deceased within three years before his death. . .". By Act No. 30 of 1939, s. 2 (c) (ii), a proviso was inserted on which a good deal turns. The material words run "Where the property comprised in any such gift consits of money . . . the property to be included in the estate pursuant to this subparagraph shall be the actual amount of the money given or paid". (at p104)

3. In Commissioner of Stamp Duties (N.S.W.) v. Perpetual Trustee Co. Ltd. (Watt's Case) (1925) 25 SR (NSW) 467, at pp 491, 492 ; [1926] HCA 14; (1926) 38 CLR 12, at pp 29, 36, 45, 47. the Supreme Court and a majority of the High Court (Higgins J. dissenting) held, to use the language of Campbell J. ". . . that it is an indispensable condition of the operation of s. 102 (2) (b) upon any gift that the subject of the gift should exist at the date of the death in some concrete indentifiable form" (1925) 25 SR (NSW), at p 502 . (Doubtless the word "concrete" was not intended to exclude a chose in action or other incorporeal right). Thus where a deceased person had caused a sum of money to be applied in buying a steamer ticket to America for a friend and in handing the balance to him in cash as an aid to his intended journey and, as Isaacs J. said (1926) 38 CLR, at p 36 , the recipient of the money and the ticket left Australia never to return, there was not a dutiable gift in existence at the donor's death. According to the suggestion of counsel for the executor upon his argument of the present appeal the proviso was inserted to meet the position disclosed by this decision in the case of gifts of money. The suggestion supposes that an unusual amount of time elapsed before the disclosure of the evil resulted in the adoption of the remedy; thirteen years. But whatever be the basis for the suggestion, it seems clear enough that the actual operation of the proviso is to clothe a gift of money with a special characteristic, namely, that of fixity, so that nothing is to be considered except the period that elapsed before the death of the donor took place. If it is less than three years from the gift, then the amount of money comprised in the gift forms part of the estate for duty, however the money may have been applied or misapplied. (at p105)

4. In the present case the money was applied in paying the purchase price of an undivided half interest in land the value of which was depressed by the continuing operation or effect of controls set up during the war that had closed. Before the death of the deceased a relaxation of the controls had allowed the value to shoot up. There is no doubt of the animus donandi of the deceased. The transaction grew out of marital mutations that were unfolding at the time and the donee was the lady who subsequently became the deceased's wife and ultimately his widow. But in the circumstances the commissioner persists in maintaining, notwithstanding the contrary opinion of the Supreme Court, that the gift was of the undivided interest in the land, the expression of the value of which underwent a sudden and huge enhancement before the deceased died. Naturally the executor seizes upon the proviso. Indeed he says that, proviso or no proviso, here you have a gift of money the amount of which is fixed and unchangeable for whatever purpose it was given and for whatever purpose it was applied. (at p105)

5. It will be necessary to look a little more closely at the facts but enough has been said to make it profitable now to give some consideration to the legislative provisions governing the question. (at p105)

6. The primary words, upon which much depends, are "any property comprised in any gift made by the deceased" scil. (within three years before his death). Perhaps it does not matter much, if at all, but we should note that "comprise" in this and other places is used in its prima facie, if not only correct meaning, of "included within"; that is to say not as exhaustively forming the category, in this case the gift. The property is to be comprehended in the gift. (at p106)

7. Every other important term in the words quoted above from s. 102 (2) (b) appears to be the subject of a statutory definition. The term "property" is defined very widely by s. 3. The definition concludes with a reference to "any thing in action and any other right or interest". The word "gift" is defined in s. 100. What is material in the definition lies in the opening words, viz. "'gift' means any disposition of property made . . . without full consideration" etc. It will be noticed that this is an exclusive definition; it does not say what the word includes but what it means. To come within it there must be a disposition of property, that is of property as defined. The important word is "disposition". The definition of that word covers many dealings with property and some extensions of the notion of alienation of proprietary interests. But for present purposes all that seems to matter can be restated in few words. Under par. (a) of the definition there is included "any conveyance transfer assignment . . . payment or other alienation of property whether at law or in equity". It is one way of stating the question in the appeal to say that it turns on a choice between treating the disposition as constituted by a payment or payments made by the deceased or treating it as an "assignment" or "other alienation of property in equity". But the commissioner relies also on par. (e) of the definition of the word "disposition". That paragraph runs thus - "Any transaction entered into by any person with intent thereby to diminish directly or indirectly the value of his own estate and to increase the value of the estate of any other person". It is not altogether clear how this provision advances the case of the commissioner, even assuming that the facts as they appear in the case stated warrant a finding or inference that the requisite intent existed in the mind of the deceased. For since the question is as to the subject of the gift, not its donative character, that is to say between the money which the deceased expended and the interest in land which his second wife obtained as a consequence, it might well be said that the money represented the value by which he diminished the value of the estate. But perhaps par. (e) is not speaking at all in terms which fit cases that fall under some or one of the preceding paragraphs of the definition. (at p106)

8. To return to the material words in par. (a) of the definition of "disposition of property", one must be struck by the fact that those quoted all refer to a process by which the deceased has divested himself of some property, right or interest as he invested the donee with the gift. This conforms with what Isaacs J. in Watt's Case [1926] HCA 14; (1926) 38 CLR 12 described as "the basic notions on which the duty is founded" (1926) 38 CLR, at p 32 "They are" said his Honour, " (1) the property in view is only that which formerly belonged to the deceased, and (2) the point of time looked at for determining the true ownership of the property is the time of death. Therefore the property, the subject of sub-s. 2 of s. 102 (except merely appointed property), is in every case property which was originally property of the deceased and ceased to belong to him by reason of his disposition referred to" (1926) 38 CLR, at p 32 . Generalisations should not be pressed too far but prima facie one expects the legislation to bring into the notional estate some right interest or property on the ground that the deceased has parted with it, that is, has parted with it in circumstances of a kind which the legislature decides should lead it to refuse recognition to the alienation for purposes of death duty: not on the ground that a gain has accrued to somebody else, stranger or relative. There are several decided cases, and there is some text book discussion, upon the question what should be considered the subject matter of a gift where what has been parted with by the de cujus has been money and what has been gained in fulfilment of his purpose by the donee has been property, tangible or intangible. Much that has been said upon the question seems almost to treat it as one of characterisation depending upon some aspect of the particular transaction. But it seems clear enough that under the same form of question either of two quite different inquiries may be intended. To ask what was given may in its application to many sets of fact be to ask a completely ambiguous question. For it may mean "What did the donor part with ?" On the other hand it may mean "What did the donee acquire in fulfilment of the donor's desire to benefit him ?" If Isaacs J. has correctly stated the prima facie purpose of the provisions of the legislation we are considering, it is the former of these two questions that we should expect par. (b) of s. 102 (2) to have in view. The introduction of the proviso by the Act of 1939 provides some confirmation of the expectation. For clearly enough it is framed upon the view that by a gift of money made within the prescribed three years of his death a deceased person depleted his assets as at the time of the gift to the extent of the payment and that as a matter of policy it should be taken conclusively that the depletion as at the death was in the same amount. It might be enough to say that for the purposes of s. 102 (2) (b) all the statute asks you to look at in order to decide between money and other forms of property as the subject of a gift is the nature of the thing of which he divested himself in effecting the gift. It is more direct and probably simpler than attempting, with the aid of decided cases, to characterise the gift independently of the intention of the provision. But it is not in every given case that a ready answer will be yielded by the question what was the thing of which the deceased divested himself in effecting the gift. For in the first place what the deceased may have parted with may be nothing so straightforward as a chattel, an interest in land or a chose in action. He may, for example, have possessed some dispositive power or authority arising out of a right of property or even of contract, and the gift may be the result of its exercise. In the next place, in the course of the transaction constituting the gift and for its very purpose the deceased may have acquired a chose in action, a chattel, an interest in land (legal or more probably equitable) or such a dispositive power. He may have retained it only momentarily and then have transferred it to the donee. Of course it will be by a payment of money that the acquisition will have been brought about. Cases can be imagined in which only a very nice dissection of the transaction will make it possible to say whether the payment was but a step whereby the deceased clothed himself with power to give a tangible or intangible thing or on the contrary was the very gift itself. (at p108)

9. It seems however better to work out the problem by beginning with the real intention of the statute rather than to ask oneself, as apparently Griffith C.J. did in Union Trustee Co. of Australia Ltd. v. Webb (1915) 19 CLR, at p 674 the question what should be regarded in substance as the real subject matter of the gift, a house which a wife contracted to purchase but the purchase money of which her husband paid or the money he paid. Isaacs J. began his answer, which appears to be open only to the criticism of being a trifle over-simplified, by saying: "The Act imposes duties in respect of what a man leaves or . . . what he has only colourably given. But it does not strike at property which he never had at law or in equity" (1915) 19 CLR, at p 676 . (at p108)

10. In Trustees Executors & Agency Co. Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation (Teare's Case) [1941] HCA 36; (1941) 65 CLR 134 a father sold his business to a company in consideration of purchase money for which he received a cheque. He and his two sons respectively applied for parcels of shares in the company, the full amount of which was payable on application and allotment. The shares they respectively applied for were allotted in the respective amounts to his sons and to himself and he paid the amount by returning the cheque to the company. For the purpose of the Estate Duty Act (Cth.) Williams J. treated the gifts to the sons, for gifts they evidently were, as gifts of money. His Honour said: "The gift was therefore in every case a gift of the moneys, the motive, and it might even be said the condition, being that they should be used to apply for the shares" (1941) 65 CLR, at p 145 . Of the other judges Starke J. said nothing expressly to the contrary, while Rich and McTiernan JJ. were actuated by the fact that the recipients of the gift did not receive the money, a reason which cannot be decisive. In the same way in Perpetual Trustee Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Sargood's Case) (1935) 36 SR (NSW) 160; 53 WN 28 the Supreme Court held that, for the purposes of s. 102 (2) (d) of the Act, a man about to marry gave his intended wife money and not a house when, having expressed a wish to give her a house as a wedding present and having requested her to choose one, he paid the purchase money which was due under the contract of sale into which she entered as purchaser. The dissenting judgment of Jordan C.J. in In the Estate of James Anderson Murdoch (1947) 48 SR (NSW) 213; 65 WN 60 adheres to the same reasoning, but the majority judgments seem rather to treat the question as if it depended upon characterisation as matter of fact. (at p109)

11. There is much in the speeches of their Lordships who formed the majority in Sneddon v. Lord Advocate (1954) AC 257 that supports the view that in legislation such as that under consideration you look for what has been alienated by the deceased. The legislature there considered was cast in a different form and moreover was referential but plainly enough Lord Morton regarded the form of the property as it passed from the donor as a test (1954) AC, at p 264 and so did Lord MacDermott (1954) AC, at pp 267, 268 and Lord Reid (1954) AC, at pp 273, 274 citing from Attorney-General v. De Preville (1900) 1 QB 223, at pp 229, 231 . (at p109)

12. In the end one may say that for present purposes it comes down to the question what did the deceased alienate. (at p109)

13. It is now desirable to turn to the precise facts of this case. Two brothers, Leslie Ross Gale named at the beginning of this judgment and Raymond Arthur Gale, carried on a business of pastoralists under the firm name of Bibaringa Pastoral Company. Leslie Ross Gale died on 29th July 1950, leaving a will made nineteen days earlier. He named his brother Raymond Arthur as executor and to him probate was granted on 4th October 1950. They carried on the business of the partnership on a grazing property bearing the name "Bibaringa", which was vested in Mary Jane Gale, wife of Leslie Ross Gale, and Myrtle Catherine Rowell Gale, wife of Raymond Arthur Gale, as tenants in common in equal shares. The firm composed of their husbands took a lease of the property from the respective wives as tenants in common. The case stated discloses nothing untoward until 1947. In that year a dissolution of partnership was arranged. Apparently it was to take effect on 1st July 1947. At the same time Mrs. M. C. R. Gale arranged with her brother-in-law Leslie Ross Gale, the now deceased, that she would transfer to him her half interest in the land and in certain household furniture, subject to encumbrances, in consideration of a sum of 2,250 pounds. Perhaps this arrangement amounted to a contract. The words of the case stated do not make it appear with any certainty, but clearly enough if there was a contract there was no writing signed by Mrs. M. C. R. Gale. One of the terms of the dissolution was that if within seven years the property, incorrectly described by the words "the equity", and certain plant machinery and vehicles included in the partnership and the household furniture should be sold for an amount exceeding 23,500 pounds, then the net profit on the sale should be divided equally between Leslie Ross Gale and Raymond Arthur Gale. It will be seen that this term takes little account of the fact that the land was vested in the two wives; the profit apparently was to be shared between the two husbands. At that time a mortgage existed over the land for 19,000 pounds. It is evident enought that the sum of 2,250 pounds is half the difference between the amount of the mortgage and the amount mentioned of 23,500 pounds. In spite of the use of the word "equity" it is quite apparent that the base figure was to be 23,500 pounds and not 4,500 pounds for the purpose of arriving at the excess or profit to be divided between the two brothers. At the time of the dissolution of partnership it appears inferentially that the price or the realisable value of the land was restricted by the operation of controls. Presumably the controls arose by or under Pt. III of the National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations. But we are told that later there was a relaxation of the controls and that as a result the property was sold after the deceased's death for 86,882 pounds. In 1947 the matrimonial relationship between the now deceased Leslie Ross Gale and his wife Mary Jane Gale completely broke down. We are not furnished with any information as to the time when the estrangement commenced. We are told, however, that a decree absolute for divorce was pronounced between them on 19th December 1947. On this event the wife, Mary Jane Gale, transferred her undivided half interest to her former husband who purchased it from her for a price unstated. This undivided half share Leslie Ross Gale retained until his death. The appeal is concerned with the other undivided half share, namely that which Mrs. M. C. R. Gale, wife of Raymond Arthur Gale, had arranged or agreed to transfer to Leslie Ross Gale, the now deceased. It appears that the latter contemplated, no doubt contingently upon his then existing marriage being dissolved, entering into a marriage with a lady named Peggy Mary Martin. On 5th December 1947 Mrs. M. C. R. Gale entered into a contract with this lady to sell to her for the sum of 2,250 pounds the undivided half share belonging to the former. The transaction was submitted to the Delegate of the Treasurer no doubt under the National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations and it was approved. Peggy Mary Martin neither then nor after she became Mrs. L. R. Gale paid any of the purchase money and no one supposes that it was ever intended that she should do so. However, between 22nd December 1947 and 18th March 1948 the deceased Leslie Ross Gale paid to his brother Raymond Arthur Gale amounts totalling 5,570 pounds 11s. 5d. These payments were in respect of the moneys owing under the agreement for dissolution of partnership and the sale of Mrs. M. C. R. Gales's undivided half share in the land. Out of the money thus received Raymond Arthur Gale accounted to his wife for the purchase price of 2,250 pounds. We are not told when the marriage took place between Peggy Mary Martin and Leslie Ross Gale now deceased, but there is a passage in the case stated which says that on 30th September 1948 M. C. R. Gale executed a transfer of her interest in "Bibaringa" in favour of Peggy Mary Martin who before that date had married the deceased. On the foregoing facts it is not difficult to understand why a contest should have arisen as to whether the subject matter of the gift by the deceased to Peggy Mary Martin, his future wife, should be regarded as a gift of money or of an undivided half share in the land. The value of the deceased's half interest in the land, that is to say the half interest he acquired from his former wife after their marriage had been dissolved, was put down as 37,772 pounds. The commissioner has of course put that sum down as the value of the disputed share and after deducting half the amount of the mortgage there is an assessable amount left of 28,272 pounds. By contrast, if the gift was only of money the assessable amount was 2,250 pounds. But once the view of s. 102 (2) (b) stated in this judgment is adopted the facts show clearly enough that if the deceased had no right title or interest legally or equitably in the undivided half share in question the gift must be considered to be one of money. For on that footing it was of money that he divested himself. To say this of course means that the interpretation of the provision already explained is applied. Is it possible on the materials in the case stated to find any interest in the deceased which, directly or indirectly, he made over to Peggy Mary Martin? It is easy to be sceptical concerning the beneficial interest in the land comprised in "Bibaringa" when the legal ownership was vested in Mary Jane Gale and M. C. R. Gale, but there is no warrant at all in the case stated for treating them as anything less than full beneficial owners. When Mrs. M. C. R. Gale fell in with the proposal that she should transfer her undivided interest to Leslie Ross Gale on the dissolution of the partnership between the brothers no enforceable contract arose between her and her brother-in-law. Indeed the commissioner seems to have placed no reliance on this transaction as investing the deceased with any disposable interest in the land. We therefore know little of the transaction in detail or her part, if any, in it. It is described in more than one paragraph in the case stated and in terms apt enough to describe the making of a contract. A document from a solicitor's office is annexed to the case. It is entitled "Suggested basis for dissolution". It contains words which rather support the hypothesis of an agreement but no payment had taken place, no transmutation of possession and there was no writing. It could not therefore have amounted to an enforceable contract. Perhaps there is enough to found a conjecture that when Miss Peggy Mary Martin became the purchaser there was a novation of whatever contract may have been discoverable between Mrs. M. C. R. Gale and her now deceased brother-in-law, but it could be no more than a conjecture and, even if it were so, much more should be known about the materials on which the novation was founded before it could be held that the deceased made over by that means to Peggy Mary Martin a right already subsisting in him to the property. Were it so there would still remain some unanswered questions. What was the value of that right? Did the deceased bind himself to furnish the money? If so, in any enforceable way? The learned Solicitor-General was conscious of these difficulties and cited Skidmore v. Bradford (1869) LR 8 Eq 134 . Sir Frederick Pollock treated that case as one of contract and nothing else: see Pollock on Principles of Contract 9th ed. (1921), p. 760 note. But in any case on the materials before us it is impossible to pursue such a line of reasoning to a conclusion in favour of the commissioner. It is quite evident that this was not the case upon which the commissioner relied. What he sought to have determined was that the total transaction amounted to a gift not of money but of an interest in land. The judgment of the Full Court of the Supreme Court is right and the appeal should be dismissed. (at p112)

I agree that the special case should be answered: No.

The sums sued for, as the special case shows, were paid by the plaintiff upon the demand of the Commissioner of Taxation, who required the plaintiff to pay them as sales tax due by him in respect of the sale of secondhand goods although, as a decision of this court subsequently showed, secondhand goods were not within the scope of the Sales Tax Acts (Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (S.A.) v. Ellis & Clark Ltd.[30]). The plaintiff was at liberty to refuse the demand. But he gave up his right to refuse to pay. The payment of the sums demanded has the character of a voluntary payment made by the plaintiff under a mistake of law about his liability to pay the sums. The decisions cited in the judgment of the Chief Justice, with whose reasons for answering the question in the negative I agree, clearly show that the plaintiff cannot recover the money paid by him in these circumstances. It is also made clear that it is erroneous to regard the moneys sued for as moneys extorted from the plaintiff by the commissioner colore officii. In my opinion the plaintiff has no right of action to recover the moneys, and in this view it is unnecessary to determine by what, if any, of the legislative powers of the Commonwealth sec. 12A of the Sales Tax Procedure Act 1934-1935 may be supported.

his case concerns in a new aspect, or at least a comparatively workman against the employer at common law and under the Act. In this instance the workman sued first for damages for injuries which, according to his allegation, he had received in the course of his work and then during what I may describe as a stet processus he made an application under the Workers' Compensation Act, 1926-1954 (N.S.W.). That proving unsuccessful, he proceeded with his common law action. There he was met by, among other things, a plea alleging that he, the plaintiff, sought in the action to recover damages said to arise from an alleged injury to his back, which injury is said by the plaintiff to have been received while he was in the course of his employment by the defendant, and that he, the plaintiff, filed in the Workers' Compensation Commission an application for determination in which he claimed to recover from the defendant compensation under the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act in respect of alleged incapacity for work alleged to have resulted from such injury; and the plea claimed in effect that the Commission had made an award stating amongst other things that the applicant has failed to establish incapacity for work in a certain defined period and that an alleged incapacity or partial incapacity for work due to a certain alleged injury to the back was not the result of any employment injury on the date alleged. (at p287)

2. The question of the relationship under the statute between the two remedies has been a source of recurrent difficulty for a very long time. Section 63(1) provides that "Nothing in this Act shall affect any civil liability of the employer where the injury was caused by the personal negligence or wilful act of the employer or of some person for whose act or default the employer is responsible." That of course means that the two liabilities and, accordingly, the two remedies, may co-exist. One view of the state of the law in force immediately before s. 63(2) took its present form will be seen in Latter v. Muswellbrook Corporation (1936) 56 CLR, at pp 438-440 . Sub-section (2) now provides: "In such case the worker may proceed both under this Act and independently of this Act but where he obtains judgment against his employer independently of this Act he shall not be entitled to any compensation under this Act other than compensation paid to him before such judgment". It seems to me that the intention of the provisions of s. 63 which I have quoted is that the rights of the worker should be cumulative except in so far as he has prosecuted one of the alternative remedies to success. To say that in the process of attempting to prosecute to success one in which he in fact failed an allegation of fact which he made might be conclusively decided against him with the consequence that he could not again make the same allegation when he turned to the other remedy appears to me to be inconsistent with the principle that inspires the remedy. Independently of other considerations I am therefore of opinion that the plea with which the plaintiff was met should fail. To give effect to the view I have expressed a new trial would be necessary.

 In this matter special leave was granted from the judgment and decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria. The facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the judgment of Fullagar J. and need no repetition. I agree entirely with his Honour's reasons. But as the matter is of very great importance I consider that I should state shortly my own reasons. The procedure adopted in this case is unfortunate as the children the subject of the controversy are not parties and will not be bound so far as the question of parentage is concerned by any order the Court may make. Usually in cases relating to the guardianship of infants no issue as to parentage is raised. Moreover one must bear in mind that proceedings by way of habeas corpus are discretionary. The question for determination in reality is whether it is for the welfare of the child that a change of custody should be ordered. Originally in England courts of law interfered by habeas corpus for the protection of the person of anybody who is suggested to be improperly detained. The old Court of Chancery interfered for the protection of infants qua infants by virtue of a prerogative which belongs to the Crown as parens patriae, and the exercise of which is delegated to the Great Seal: Re Spence (1847) 2 Ph 247 at p 252 (41 ER 937, at p 938) . Now under the Judicature Act the High Court in England has inherited the combined powers of the courts whose functions were transferred to it. (at p638)

2. In the instant case as the matter is governed by the law of Victoria it is essential to have regard to the Marriage Acts, 1928-1941 (Vict.) which in s. 136 - adapted from s. 1 of 9 & 10 Geo. V. c. 71 - provides that the Court in deciding the question of the custody or the upbringing of an infant shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration. "The duty of the Court," said Lindley L.J., "is in our judgment to leave the child alone, unless the Court is satisfied that it is for the welfare of the child that some other course should be taken": In re McGrath (1893) 1 Ch 143 . And this being the basal consideration this Court as a Court of Appeal "must approach the matter independently and not as a matter determined by the discretion of the Court below": In re J. M. Carroll (1931) 1 KB 317, at p 333 . The Court sits primarily to guard the interests of the infant and its jurisdiction is in this respect parental and administrative and the disposal of controverted questions is an incident only in the jurisdiction - Scott v. Scott (1913) AC 417, at p 437 per Viscount Haldane L.C. - and this doctrine should, I think, be observed by this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. (at p638)

3. The appellants treated parentage as the sole issue in the case instead of something merely supplemental to the main issue, namely the welfare of the child. No evidence or none that is convincing was led to prove that a change of custody would in any way benefit the child. On the contrary, it appears that the present custody is satisfactory and conducive to the health, happiness and general well-being of the child. The appellants, on whom the onus lies, have not proved that any change is necessary. The claim made and the issue raised by the appellants are that of parentage and I cannot conceive that any advantage or benefit would at this stage accrue to the infant even if it would gratify the female appellant. The evidence shows that the male appellant was not anxious to make any application. His relations towards the child are shown in the following passages from his evidence:- "I was not anxious to go on with the matter. I take it that you are very fond of Johanne Lee and so is your wife? - Yes. May we take it that Johanne Lee has been at all times brought up as an integral member of your family? - Yes. At no stage has she ever been given cause to think that she was not a member of your family? No, at no time. There is no question that she unquestionably regards you as her father and your wife as her mother? - No question whatever. And the other two children believe that she is their sister? - Yes. So that, as far as your family circle is concerned, Johanne Lee always has been and is now an integral part of your family? - That is true. And we may take it that you and your wife have a strong attachment for the child? - Yes. Does she get on with the other two children as one of themselves? - Yes. When was it that you first consulted your solicitor about the matter? - I came down to town and knew nobody in Melbourne. I had not been there for any lenght of time and had not had any dealings with any solicitors at all and I was advised to go and see Mr. Galbally. When was it that you first consulted your solicitor? - Some time early this year, I think. We have a letter from Mr. Galbally dated 6th February 1948 to Mrs. Jenkins at Kyabram. It must have been some time early this year, don't you think? - That is right. That would be after the article that appeared in 'Truth'? - Yes. I take it that you saw the article that appeared in 'Truth' newspaper some time in January? - Yes, I did." (at p639)

4. No doubt in ordinary circumstances a child should be with its parents but in the instant case the circumstances are unique or at least unusual. Between the parties to this proceeding a de facto relationship has existed for four years and four months and each child was suckled by the respective mother from the hour of its birth. In the ordinary litigation there is no doubt or issue as to parentage and the child knows the parent as its parent. After this length of time a change of custody would wrench the child from its present happy and contented condition and throw it into an unknown place and among persons strangers to her. The result would be a menace not only to its health and happiness but would also affect the welfare of the other child: cf. R. v. Murdoch (1940) VLR 61, at pp 65, 66 . For nearly five years a de facto parentage has existed and also a de facto relationship of brother and sister with the other children of each family. In these circumstances it would be disastrous to upset the present conditions and cause unrest and unhappiness to both children. Moreover, there is real doubt whether Nola is the child of the Morrisons and this is another factor to be taken into consideration in determining the issue of welfare. I am not satisfied that the scientific evidence is infallible. At most it goes to show that Johanne Lee is not the child of the Morrison union. But it neither shows nor purports to show that Nola Jenkins is the child of that union although it does show that Johanne Lee could be the child of Mrs. Morrison. On this issue the appellants must exclude every other reasonable hypothesis. Did a mistake in fact occur? The evidence of Mrs. Williams is inconsistent with that of her daughter, the female appellant, and is also inconsistent with the finding of the learned primary judge that the exchange of babies occurred shortly after birth. Moreover at the time of the alleged mistake two other recently born babies - the Perry and Hayes children - were born on the 19th and 20th June in the same nursery in the same hospital. The appellants led no evidence as to these children or their mothers or that either mother had ever seen her child before the morning of 22nd June. In these circumstances the possibility of a mistake with either of these children cannot be excluded. Thus the probability of a mistake with the Jenkins' child to the exclusion of any other is considerably lessened, if, indeed, a mistake did in fact occur. A decision as to parentage will not bind the child and at a later stage in other proceedings - for example under a will or settlement - in which the child should be a party a decision contrary to that in the instant case would be a grievous blow to the happiness and welfare of the child. Indeed in a proceeding to which the child is not a party the Court has no jurisdiction to decide a question of legitimacy. (at p640)

5. I would dismiss the appeal. (at p640)

The plaintiff attacks the validity of the notice of acquisition published in the Government Gazette dated 15th October 1963 on the ground that the purpose which it specifies as the purpose for which the land is acquired is not a "public purpose" within the meaning of the Lands Acquisition Act 1955- 1957 (Cth). The purpose stated in the notice is "the provision of broadcasting and television studios and offices for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in accordance with the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1962". The Lands Acquisition Act in s. 5 (1) defines "public purpose" as "a purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws, and in relation to land in a Territory of the Commonwealth includes any purpose in relation to that Territory". It is my view that the words in the notice purporting to express the public purpose required by s. 10 (3) of the Lands Acquisition Act do in fact express a purpose. The test is laid down by the Chief Justice in Jones v. The Commonwealth [1963] HCA 43; (1963) 109 CLR 475 : "I do not regard a corporation as a purpose within the meaning of this statute. What it does may afford purposes, what it desires to do may afford purposes, what it is authorized to do may afford purposes, but that is not the same thing as the corporation itself" (1963) 109 CLR, at p 483. The statement in the notice here under consideration clearly indicates that the Commonwealth of Australia desires to acquire the land so that it may erect broadcasting and television studios and offices pursuant to the Broadcasting and Television Act. But does the purpose constitute a "public purpose" within the meaning of s. 6 (1) of the Lands Acquisition Act? The purpose is limited in its terms to the performance of certain functions which are authorized by the Broadcasting and Television Act, so the issue is whether those provisions of that Act relating to the provision of broadcasting and television studios and offices are within the constitutional power of the Federal Parliament. However, it is clear that if those provisions are in fact intra vires, the purpose expressed in the notice of acquisition published in the said Government Gazette is a "public purpose" within the meaning of the Lands Acquisition Act. (at p220)

2. It is further contended by the plaintiff that the land the subject-matter of this action and in respect of which the notice was given is "dedicated or reserved . . . as a public park or otherwise for the purposes of public recreation" within the meaning of s. 6 (2) of the Lands Acquisition Act, which prohibits the Commonwealth from acquiring such land. The land is subject to the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works Interim Development Order 1961 made pursuant to the Town and Country Planning Act 1961 (Vict.). The land falls under the operation of Pt III of the Order. Part III is headed "Reserved Land". Clause 32 (1) of the Order declares the land to be "deemed to be reserved for the purpose or purposes set forth", in the appropriate table. The purpose in this case is "Open Space - public proposed". Clause 33 then allows the land so "reserved" pursuant to cl. 32 to be used (a) for the purpose for which it was used immediately before the date on which the Order came into operation, (b) for such other purpose as the responsible authority permits and (c) for the purpose for which the land is deemed to be reserved. Further, cll. 35 and 36 prohibit without the consent of the responsible authority the removal or damaging of trees on the land, and demolition, damaging, construction, erection, extension, or alteration of buildings or works on the land. The land is to be in no way spoiled or wasted so as to destroy, affect or impair its usefulness for the purpose or purposes for which it is reserved. It is my view that the designation "open space - . . . public" falls within the scope of the words "public park". A park is a piece of land either kept in its natural state or ornamentally laid out for the purpose of public recreation. The two distinctive features of this term are that the land has no buildings erected upon it and remains open space, and that it is available for use by the public. (at p221)

3. Further, I think that the effect of the restrictions laid on the use of the land by the Order is to "reserve" the land. To reserve a thing, real or personal, is to set it aside, to appropriate it, or to give it up to some special purpose. The Order in its terms prohibits the use of the land for any purpose other than its existing use and the purposes for which it is reserved. Seeing that one of the essential aspects of an appropriation or a setting aside is the withholding of the thing appropriated from any use other than the ones designated it seems clear that the Order in substance does constitute a reservation of the land. It is not important that the existing use of the land can be continued. The fact that there are two or more reserved purposes does not make the reservation for the public purpose of no effect. (at p221)

4. However, it is argued that for two reasons the effect of the Order is not to make a reservation within the meaning of the Lands Acquisition Act. The first is that in the scheme of the Town and Country Planning Act, interim development orders are merely a kind of temporary injunction designed to regulate the use of land pending the making of a final planning order and will be superseded by the making of the final planning order in which the reservation may not be preserved. In my view, this feature of the Order does not make its effect any the less a reservation. Even though the Order may not be final nevertheless it effectually reserves while it is in force, and there is nothing in s. 6 (2) of the Lands Acquisition Act to indicate that the reservation contemplated must be permanent and irrevocable. Indeed, as was pointed out by Mr. Aickin many other forms of reservation are subject to alteration and revocation. The second objection is that s. 6 (2) contemplates that if the land reserved is to be protected from acquisition by the Commonwealth it must at the time of acquisition be used as a public park. The land the subject-matter of this action was not at the time of the service of the notice being used as a public park but as a private garden which was its use at the time of the commencement of the operation of the Order. According to the language of s. 6 (2) land is protected from acquisition if it is "reserved . . . as a public park". It is said that the word "as" means in this context that the land has already passed into use as a public park, not merely set aside for use as such in the future; and, that if the provision was intended to protect the land in the latter situation the words "reserved for a public park" would have been used. I think that this is too restrictive a construction to do justice to the provision. The words "reserved as" mean that the purpose of the reservation is that the land is a park or to be used as such because of an effective reservation. The expression "reserved . . . as a public park" has not a technical meaning. It should be construed according to the ordinary meaning of the words. The word "reserved" is concerned both with preserving the current use of the land as a park and to save the land for use as a park if reserved for such a use. I think that the expression upon its proper construction covers the situation not only where land is at present being used for a park being the subject of a reservation for that purpose but also where land is the subject of a reservation protecting it for use as a park in the future. I reach the conclusion that the land is "reserved . . . as a public park" within the meaning of s. 6 (2) of the Lands Acquisition Act and is thus protected from acquisition by the Commonwealth because of the operation of the Order. (at p222)

5. The view which I take of the objection raised under s. 6 (2) of the Lands Acquisition Act renders it unnecessary for me to add anything further to show that the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that the acquisition is invalid. However, I would like to express briefly my opinion that the transmission of messages, that is, sound and pictures, to listeners and viewers by television is a "like" service within the meaning of s. 51 (v.) of the Constitution. I think that the reasoning of the majority in R. v. Brislan; Ex parte Williams [1935] HCA 78; (1935) 54 CLR 262 is adequate to support this conclusion. As to ss. 59 and 60 of the Broadcasting and Television Act, I think that it is an erroneously narrow view of what is incidental to the conduct of a television service to hold that these sections travel beyond its well recognized functions. Like every other power conferred upon the Parliament by s. 51 of the Constitution, par. (v.) of that section must be given an ample construction consistent with the subject-matter in respect of every service within its scope. So far as broadcasting and television are concerned, it is not an exhaustive description of either service to say that it consists only of the transmission of messages handed to it. The very description "broadcasting and television service" implies something more than the mere provision of a method of communication. Proper incidents of such services are the preparation of programmes for broadcasting to inform and entertain the public. It is incidental, therefore, to the conduct of the service not only to provide and compile adequate and comprehensive programmes for transmission but also to take appropriate measures to maintain a supply of programmes for transmission, and to inform and interest the public in such activities. As I understand the language of the sections in question, they are laws directed to purposes covered by par. (v.) so far as it relates to broadcasting and television services. For these reasons I hold that ss. 59 and 60 fall within s. 51 (v.) of the Constitution. (at p223)

6. However because in my view the Commonwealth has attempted an acquisition prohibited by s. 6 (2) of the Lands Acquisition Act I would overrule the demurrer. (at p223)

McTIERNAN A.C.J. In this case, the plaintiff Susan McHale suffered serious own age and of Barry Watson, then aged twelve years and two months, a few years older than the others. It was school holidays in January 1957 and Susan and her mother had come from South Australia on a visit to Portland in Victoria and Barry and his mother had come from New South Wales also as visitors to that town. The children had met, being neighbours, in Lighthouse Street, Portland, and late in the afternoon of January 21st played chasings, a children's game also known as tag, in which one player called "it" chases the others until one is touched or tagged and that player in turn becomes "it". A structure made of four corner posts of hardwood, with pickets between them, was "base" for the game. Each post was four feet high and measured 3" X 2": the pickets were short and above them the structure was open. The enclosed area was about four square feet and within it was a young ornamental tree. There was a row of such structures each enclosing a tree in the street. When the game was at an end Susan and Barry were on opposite sides of the tree guard called "base". She was to Barry's left and he was standing facing a corner post: the distance between the two children was little more than the distance between two sides of the guard; both were, of course, outside it. Barry took an object from his pocket and threw it in front of him. It hit Susan in the right eye with sad consequences to her; the sight of the eye was destroyed. The object was a round piece of welding rod, of small circumference, and six inches long. One end had been sharpened by Barry on the rocks at the beach where he had been earlier in the day amusing himself in the company of another young boy by spearing starfish and prizing shell-fish off the rocks with this implement. He had picked it up outside his father's workshop on his way to the beach. (at p202)

2. There was a contest at the trial whether Barry had aimed it at Susan. She and one of her young companions said in evidence that he had done so. Windeyer J. did not accept the evidence of either of the girls on that point. Barry said in evidence that he aimed the object at the corner post which he was facing, his idea being to make it stick in the post. The object was made of soft steel; in form it was not finished as a dart although it was described as such in the statement of claim. The learned judge was impressed by Barry's demeanour as a witness and regarded his account of the accident as more probable than that of the others. His Honour analysed the evidence and reasoned from it to his conclusion on the question how Susan came to be hit in the eye by the object. He considered that in all probability the object hit the corner post, which Barry was facing, with force and glanced off it in the direction of Susan. Barry was standing a degree left of the post and threw the object with his left hand. In argument counsel for the plaintiff attacked the finding and contended that the evidence could not support it. In my opinion the evidence would not justify a finding that the object did not strike the post at which Barry aimed it before it struck Susan in the eye. (at p202)

3. In the action Susan claimed damages from Barry upon a cause of action framed in trespass and a second cause of action in negligence. The allegations made in the statement of claim are that Barry either threw the object directly at Susan or in her direction. These allegations are traversed in the defence. As regards trespass, Barry also pleaded that the occurrence was an inevitable accident and was not due to negligence or default on his part (see Stanley v. Powell (1891) 1 QB 86). Windeyer J., in the reasons for his decision, discussed the question of whether the defendant had the onus of proving the special matters alleged in his defence and referred to a number of authorities. His Honour then said: "I accept Doctor Bray's proposition that as Barry Watson threw the thing which hit the plaintiff in the eye he is liable for the consequences, unless I am satisfied, on the balance of the probabilities, that he did not intend it to hit her and that he was not negligent in throwing it as and when he did" (1964) 111 CLR, at p 389. (at p203)

4. Windeyer J. said in his reasons for judgment: "It has been strongly urged for the plaintiff that, in considering whether Barry was negligent, I must judge what he did by the standard expected of a reasonable man, and that that standard is not graduated according to age. In one sense, of course, that is so; for the question whether conduct was negligent, in a legal sense, always depends on an objective standard. This has been generally recognized ever since Tindal C.J. said in Vaughan v. Menlove [1837] EngR 424; (1837) 3 Bing (NC) 468 (132 ER 490) : 'Instead of saying that the liability for negligence should be coextensive with the judgment of each individual, which would be as variable as the length of the foot of each individual, we ought rather to adhere to the rule which requires in all cases a regard to caution such as a man of ordinary prudence would observe' (1837) 3 Bing (NC), at p 475 (132 ER, at p 493) . In Glasgow Corporation v. Muir [1943] UKHL 2; (1943) AC 448 Lord Macmillan said: 'The standard of foresight of the reasonable man is, in one sense, an impersonal test. It eliminates the personal equation and is independent of the idiosyncrasies of the particular person whose conduct is in question . . . . The reasonable man is presumed to be free both from over-apprehension and from over-confidence, but there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable man involves in its application a subjective element. It is still left to the judge to decide what, in the circumstances of the particular case, the reasonable man would have had in contemplation, and what accordingly the party sought to be made liable ought to have foreseen' (1943) AC, at p 457 . That is the question I have to determine. It is a question of fact, a jury question, not a question of law. I have not to determine it by regarding the facts of other cases, but by regarding all the circumstances of this case. I do not think that I am required to disregard altogether the fact that the defendant Barry Watson was at the time only twelve years old. In remembering that I am not considering 'the idiosyncrasies of the particular person'. Childhood is not an idiosyncrasy. It may be that an adult, knowing of the resistant qualities of hardwood and of the uncertainty that a spike, not properly balanced as a dart, will stick into wood when thrown, would foresee that it might fail to do so and perhaps go off at a tangent. A person who knew, or might reasonably be expected to know that might be held to be negligent if he were not more circumspect than was this infant defendant. But whatever the position would be if the facts were different, my conclusion on the facts of this case is that the injury to the plaintiff was not the result of a lack of foresight and appreciation of the risk that might reasonably have been expected, or of a want of reasonable care in aiming the dart. I find that Barry Watson was not negligent in the legal sense" (1964) 111 CLR, at pp 396, 397 . (at p204)

5. The appeal was argued on two main grounds: first that his Honour was in error in holding that the liability or degree of responsibility of the defendant Barry Watson or the standard of care to be exercised by him in any way differed from the liability degree of responsibility or standard of care which would have been proper had he been over the age of twenty-one years; and secondly that his Honour should have made a finding of negligence whether he applied the standard of the ordinary reasonable man or the standard (whatever it might be) appropriate to a twelve-year-old boy. (at p204)

6. I do not agree with either of those grounds. In my opinion the passage which I have quoted from his Honour's judgment does not contain any misdirection in law and I see no reason for interfering with his conclusion. The crucial question is whether his Honour erred in saying that he could not disregard the fact that the defendant Barry Watson was twelve years old at the time of the accident and in order to answer that question it is necessary to determine by what standard of care the infant defendant should be judged. It is a well-established principle that an infant may be held liable for torts which are not ex contractu, but there is a paucity of judicial authority on the standard of care applicable to young children. Perhaps this lack of authority is due to the fact that young children are rarely worth suing and plaintiffs usually rely on making parents and guardians liable for the wrongful acts of their children and charges as was attempted in another case heard with the present and which Windeyer J. dismissed. (at p204)

7. There is ample authority for the proposition that in cases dealing with alleged contributory negligence on the part of young children they are expected to exercise the degree of care one would expect, not of the average reasonable man, but of a child of the same age and experience. No Australian or English decision was cited relating to the standard to be applied where a young child is sued in negligence. The subject, however, is discussed in several textbooks and there seems to be a consensus that the age and experience of an infant should be taken into account when considering the reasonableness of his conduct. The learned author of Salmond on Torts, 13th ed. (1961), at pp. 77, 78 said: "it would seem that in order to make a child liable for negligence, it must be proved that he failed to show the amount of care reasonably to be expected from a child of that age. It is not enough that an adult would have been guilty of negligence had he acted in the same way in the same circumstances. This, indeed, seems never to have been decided, but it would seem implied in the decisions on the contributory negligence of children. In general the principle appears to be that a minor who is incapable of forming a culpable intention or of realizing the probable consequences of his conduct is relieved from liability in those cases in which fault is essential to liability, but that wherever a liability is imposed irrespective of fault he is fully liable as a normal adult". In Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 12th ed. (1961), par. 157 it is stated: "by analogy with the cases concerning contributory negligence of young children it seems probable that the age of an infant defendant is relevant in torts involving negligence or malice. If the defendant is of tender years it will be a question of fact whether he is of such age that he ought to have foreseen the consequences of his act, and that malice or want of due care could reasonably be ascribed to him". Fleming, The Law of Torts, 3rd ed. (1965), pp. 117, 118 is to the same effect: "there is no doubt that a child, whether as plaintiff or defendant, is only expected to conform to the standard appropriate for children of the same age, intelligence and experience. If unable to understand the nature and likely consequences of his actions, negligence is not attributed to him at all ; but given perception of the risk, he must display the judgment and behaviour proper for a child with like attributes. Some safeguard to the public is afforded by the obligation of parents and school authorities to observe reasonable care in the supervision of children under their control. Moreover, a minor who engages in dangerous adult activities, such as driving a car or handling industrial equipment, must conform to the standard of the reasonably prudent adult ; his position being analogous to that of beginners who, as we have seen, are held to the objective standard". (at p206)

8. The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Walmsley v. Humenick (1954) 2 DLR 232 is frequently cited in this connexion. In that case the infant defendant, who was a child not quite five years of age shot an arrow which struck another child and resulted in the loss of that child's right eye. The plaintiff sued the infant defendant and his parents, although the plaintiff's counsel did not rely heavily on the allegation of negligence against the infant defendant. In the course of his reasons for judgment Clyne J. stated : "I think the circumstances coupled with the evidence of the children would be sufficient to justify a finding of negligence in an adult, or at least I am prepared to assume so for the sake of argument. The cases clearly demonstrate, however, that what may be lack of reasonable care in an adult cannot be considered to be so in the case of a child having regard to its capacity to understand and appreciate the nature of its actions. Speaking of a boy of four, Davis J. held in Hudson's Bay Co. v. Wyrzykowski (1938) 3 DLR 1, at p 5 ; (1938) SCR 278, at p 286 : 'The child on account of its age was incapable of negligence on its part.' In an earlier negligence case, Acadia Coal Co. v. McNeil (1927) 3 DLR 871, at p 876 ; (1927) SCR 497, at p 504 , Newcombe J. in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court said : 'Children aged seven and nine years have by the common law the benefit of something in the nature of a presumption that they have not sufficient capacity to know that they are doing wrong.' . . . In the present case I have no hesitation in finding that the infant defendant had not reached that state of mental development where it could be said that he should be found legally responsible for his negligent acts. Putting it another way, it might be said that at his age he had not yet acquired that capacity to reason which would place him within the category of the 'reasonable man' as that term is used in the cases defining negligence. Because of the defendant child's lack of capacity, the plaintiff's cause of action against him based on negligence must fail" (1954) 2 DLR, at p 238 . (at p206)

9. His Honour accepted the view taken by Manson J. in Sheasgreen v. Morgan (1952) 1 DLR 48 that "mere age is not in itself the test but rather the capacity of the infant to understand" (1952) 1 DLR, at p 61 . It would appear, however, that his Honour decided the case on the incapacity of a child of this age to commit a tort rather than on the basis that the child exercised the degree of care one would expect of a child of his age. If this is so then the case is of little use in deciding the instant case. (at p207)

10. In Joseph v. Swallow & Ariell Pty. Ltd. [1933] HCA 47; (1933) 49 CLR 578 Dixon J. (as he then was) commented on the passages to be found in Beven on Negligence, 4th ed. (1928), vol. 1, pp. 182, 183. His Honour said : "Mr. Beven himself appears to have taken the view that a child under seven years of age was not open to a charge of contributory negligence ; that a child so young could not be considered a responsible agent upon whom the ordinary duty of care rested. But, in deference to some Scottish cases, the editors of his work are disposed to abandon so definite a rule and to allow that a child is under a duty to exercise such a degree of care for his own and others' safety as might reasonably be expected from one of his age and capacity" (1933) 49 CLR, at p 585 . (at p207)

11. There is ample American authority in favour of applying a lower standard of care in cases involving the primary negligence of young children. The American Restatement of the Law of Tort, par. 283, divides infants into three categories for the purpose of discussing the standard of care applicable. The categories and the standards of care required are as follows : -

    (a) Children who are so young as to be manifestly incapable
    of exercising any of the qualities necessary to the perception of risk. 

This group would comprise babies and children of very tender years and instead of formulating a standard of care for them it suffices to say that they are incapable of negligence. (b) Infants who, although they have not yet attained majority,
are capable as adults of foreseeing the probable consequences of their actions. In view of the capabilities of this class the standard of care required of them is the same as that required of adults. (c) Children who come between the extremes indicated in the
above categories and whose capacities are infinitely various. The standard of care required of these children is that which it is reasonable to expect of children of like age, intelligence and experience. (at p207)


12. In 27 Am. Jur., p. 814, the position is summarized as follows : "in cases of torts arising from negligence, although there is some authority to the contrary, there is authority to the effect that the age and capacity of the infant charged with the tortious negligence may become matters of importance. There is authority to the effect that a minor charged with actionable negligence is not to be held to the standard of care of an adult without regard to his nonage and want of experience. Reasonable care, having regard to the age and state of development of the individual, is required of minors as well as adults, and no different measure is to be applied to their primary than to their contributory faults. It has been stated that a child's care must be measured by its intelligence. It has also been stated that a child is required to exercise only that degree of care which the great mass of children of the same age ordinarily exercise under the same circumstances, taking into account the experience, capacity, and understanding of the child. A minor whose negligence is in question is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, universally considered to be lacking in judgment". Prosser on Torts, 2nd ed. (1955), p. 128 contains a similar statement. The author considers that the standard of care applicable to children must necessarily be a subjective one although it is not entirely subjective and "if the conclusion is that the conduct of the child was unreasonable in view of his estimated capacity, he may still be found negligent, even as a matter of law". (at p208)

13. The learned authors of Harper and James, The Law of Torts, refer to the problem in vol. 2 at pp. 926, 927. They point out that the commentators and Courts are divided on the question. They conclude, however : "courts should and probably will (for the most part) hold the child defendant who is engaging in dangerous adult activities (such as driving a car) to the standard of the reasonably prudent adult. It is less important and more doubtful what rule will emerge as to injuries caused by children at play". (at p208)

14. I shall refer to two American cases. In the case of Charbonneau v. MacRury (1931) 73 Am LR 1266 the administrator of a minor's estate commenced an action to recover damages for injuries resulting in death which were allegedly caused by the negligence of the defendant who was also a minor. The defendant was licensed to drive a motor vehicle under a statute which provided for the issue of a licence after proof that the applicant was a proper person to receive it and forbade the issue of a licence to any person under sixteen years of age. It was argued on behalf of the plaintiff that this fact conclusively established that the defendant's capacity to exercise care was the same as that of an adult. This argument was rejected and judgment entered for the minor defendant. The plaintiff conceded that the infancy of a person is of material importance in determining whether he has been guilty of contributory negligence but contended that a minor charged with actionable negligence is to be held to the standard of care of an adult without regard to his nonage and want of experience. Snow J. who delivered the judgment of the Court stated that, in the case where a minor's contributory negligence had been in issue, the conclusion of the Court that his infancy was a factor to be considered had been expressed in terms which applied to his primary as well as to his contributory fault. His Honour concluded : "There is nothing in the language of these cases which suggests any distinction between the care required of an infant in his own protection and that exacted of him in his conduct towards others. On the contrary, it tends to refute such a distinction" (1931) 73 Am LR, at p 1272 . The Court held that "the law recognizes that indulgence must be shown the minor in appraising the character of his conduct. This is accomplished however through no arbitrary exception to the general rule of reasonable care under all the circumstances. As we have said this is always the test. But what is reasonable when the actor is a minor? Manifestly the adult test of the standard man cannot be applied in disregard of the actor's youth and inexperience. Either a new standard denoting the average person of the minor's age and development must be taken as the yardstick, or else allowance must be made for the minor's stage of development as one of the circumstances incident to the application of the general rule of reasonable care. As a practical matter it is not important which course is pursued. This court, however, is inclined to approve the latter both as supporting the theory that reasonable care under all the circumstances is a universal rule, and in the interest of simplicity of applying the law to the facts" (1931) 73 Am LR, at p 1274 . (at p209)

15. In Hoyt v. Rosenberg (1947) 173 Am LR 883 a boy of twelve years was playing a game of "kick the can" and the plaintiff was one of the participants. In the course of the game the boy kicked the can so that it struck the girl in the face and resulted in her losing the use of an eye. Barnard P.J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, stated : "There is no dispute as to the general rules of law here applicable. While a minor, like an adult, is required to exercise ordinary care he is only required to exercise that degree or amount of care that is ordinarily exercised by one of like age, experience and development" (1947) 173 Am LR, at p 886 . The Court referred to the "established rule that a minor is expected to use, not the quantum of care expected of an adult, but only that degree or amount of care which is ordinarily used by children of the same age under similar circumstances. In deciding whether, in such a case, there has been a failure to use ordinary care to avoid injury to other children, the test is, and must be, not what an adult would have there done or what the results indicate should have been done, but what an ordinary child in that situation would have done" (1947) 173 Am LR, at pp 888, 889 . (at p210)

16. In the present case we are concerned with a boy of the age of twelve years and two months. He was not, of course, a child of tender years. On the other hand, he was not grown up and, according to the evidence, he played as a child. I think it was right for the learned trial judge to refer to him in common with Susan and the other paymates as young children. It cannot be laid down as an absolute proposition that a boy of twelve years of age can never be liable in negligence ; nor that he would always be liable in the same manner as an adult in the case of that tort. The defendant's conduct in relation to this object which he threw, a useless piece of scrap metal, is symbolic of the tastes and simplicity of boyhood. He kept the object in his pocket after using it earlier in the day to scrape marine life off the rocks at the beach ; after that he carried it around with him for the rest of the day until the accident happened. It was the type of thing that a wise parent would take from a boy if he thought the boy would play with it as a dart in the company of other children. The defendant on his way from the beach took the object from his pocket to show Susan and her companions, whom he met playing in a paddock, what he was doing at the beach - apparently he was proud of how he had transformed the piece of scrap metal by rubbing it on the rocks. The game of chasings having ended, the wooden corner post was an allurement or temptation to him to play with the object as a dart. If it had stuck into the post at the first throw, doubtless, he would not have been content with one throw. The evidence does not suggest that the defendant was other than a normal twelve-year-old-boy. His Honour considered that the defendant, being a boy of twelve years, did not have enough maturity of mind to foresee that the dart might glance off the post in the direction of Susan if he did not make it hit the post squarely, and that there was a possibility that he might not succeed in doing so. It seems to me that the present case comes down to a fine point, namely whether it was right for the trial judge to take into account Barry's age in considering whether he did foresee or ought to have foreseen that the so-called dart might not stick in the post but be deflected from it towards Susan who was in the area of danger in the event of such an occurrence. I think that there is no ground for disagreeing with the conclusion of Windeyer J. on this question. The correctness of this decision depends upon the special circumstances of the case and it does not lay down any general principle that a young boy who cannot be classified as a grown-up person cannot be guilty of negligence in any circumstances. (at p211)

17. I would dismiss the appeal. (at p211)

On 21st November 1973 the Australian Bank Officials' pursuant to the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (as amended), "the Act", filed with the Industrial Registrar of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission two applications pursuant to the provisions in s. 139 (1) of the Act. The first of the said applications was an application for the consent of the Industrial Registrar to an alteration made to the rules of the Association insofar as they related to conditions of eligibility for membership of the Association. The second of the said applications was an application for the consent of the Industrial Registrar to an alteration made to the rules insofar as they related to the description of the industry in connexion with which the Association is registered pursuant to the provisions of the Act. (at p598)

2. The rules of the Association sought to be altered by the first of the said applications provided as follows:

    "3. The Association is open to all employees in or in
    connection with the industry of Banking in Australia,
    together with Life Members
    appointed by any Branch of the Association and
    such other persons whether or not employees in the industry as
    have been appointed officers of the Association and admitted as
    members thereof." (at p599)

3. The said first application sought consent to the alteration of the said rule to the following:

    "3. The Association is open to all employees in or in
    connection with the industry of Banking in Australia and all
    employees in or in connection with the industry of Credit
    Unions in Australia, together with Life Members appointed by
    any Branch of the Association and such other persons whether
    or not employees in the industry as have been appointed officers
    of the Association and admitted as members thereof." (at p599)

4. The second of the said applications sought the consent of the Industrial Registrar to an alteration of the rules of the Association insofar as those rules related to the description of industry in connexion with which the Association is registered from "The Industry of Banking" to "The Industry of Banking and the Industry of Credit Unions". (at p599)

5. The Federated Clerks' Union of Australia, "the prosecutor", an organization of employees registered pursuant to the provisions of the Act, pursuant to reg. 127 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations made under the Act, objected to both of the said applications. The prosecutor has, and has had for many years, members who are employees of credit unions throughout Australia and has actively advanced the industrial interests of those members by making claims and obtaining awards and determinations for them in the industrial tribunals of Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. (at p599)

6. The said applications came on for hearing before the Industrial Registrar on 12th March 1974 and on subsequent days, the Victorian Employers' Federation on behalf of the Victorian Credit Co-operative Association Ltd. was also represented. The Victorian Employers' Federation submitted that the Industrial Registrar did not have jurisdiction to proceed to hear the said applications or either of them or otherwise deal with the same since employees of credit unions are not employees in or in connexion with an "industry". (at p599)

7. On 23rd May 1974 the Industrial Registrar gave his decision in the said applications. The Industrial Registrar decided inter alia that credit unions were within the expression "in or in connection with any industry" and granted the said applications. On 5th June 1974 the Industrial Registrar recorded in the register the said alterations in the said rules. (at p599)

8. The prosecutor is aggrieved by the said decision of the Industrial Registrar and seeks, from this Court in its original jurisdiction, a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the Industrial Registrar of 23rd May 1974 or alternatively a writ of prohibition directed to the Industrial Registrar and to the Association restraining them and each of them from proceeding further in the purported alterations to the said rules. (at p600)

9. Section 132 of the Act reads:

    "(1) Any of the following associations or persons may, on
    compliance with the prescribed conditions, be registered in the
    manner prescribed as an organization -
    . . .
    (b) Any association the members of which include not less
    than one hundred employees in or in connexion with any
    industry and the other members, if any, of which are -
    (i) officers of the association;
    (ii) persons who follow an occupation in or in
    connexion with that industry; or
    (iii) persons who are employees who are qualified to be
    employed in or in connexion with that industry,
    but does not include an association that has members
    referred to in sub-paragraph (ii) or (iii) unless the
    association is effectively representative of the members
    who are employees in or in connexion with that industry;
    and
    (c) Any association the members of which include not less
    than one hundred employees engaged in an industrial
    pursuit or pursuits and the other members, if any, of
    which are -
    (i) officers of the association;
    (ii) persons engaged in that industrial pursuit or one of
    those industrial pursuits otherwise than as
    employees; or
    (iii) persons who are qualified to be engaged as
    employees in that industrial pursuit or in one of those
    industrial pursuits,
    but does not include an association which has members
    referred to in sub-paragraph (ii) or (iii) unless the
    association is effectively representative of the members
    who are employees engaged in that industrial pursuit or
    those industrial pursuits." (at p600)

10. Section 4 (1) of the Act says except when otherwise clearly intended - "Industry" includes:

    "(a) any business, trade, manufacture, undertaking, or calling of
    employers;
    (b) any calling, service, employment, handicraft, or industrial
    occupation or vocation of employees; and
    (c) a branch of an industry and a group of industries;" (at p600)

11. The question which is raised by this matter is whether credit unions in Australia constitute an "industry" within the meaning of the Act. Counsel for the prosecutor argued that the word "industry" must be read in the light of s. 51(xxxv.) of the Constitution, which provides that "(t)he Parliament shall . . . have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to : Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State". This argument is clearly right. In the Jumbunna Case, O'Connor J. said (1908) 6 CLR 309, at p 365 , "If, therefore, 'industry' includes classes of labour not covered by the word 'industrial' in sub-s. xxxv. of s. 51 of the Constitution, it is clear that the Act has gone beyond the limits within which the Parliament has power to legislate." Counsel for the respondent Association, as I understand his argument, contended that the word "industry" is used in s. 132 of the Act in relation to registration of organizations without any degree of circumscription derived from placitum (xxxv.). In my opinion the interpretation in s. 4 of the Act of "Industry" applies to s. 132. (at p601)

12. Credit unions are in fact employers and disputes may occur between credit unions and their employees as to conditions of employment. If such disputes would be "industrial disputes" for the purposes of placitum (xxxv.) then credit unions would constitute an "industry" within the meaning of the Act. It is said in the State School Teachers' Case [1929] HCA 11; (1929) 41 CLR 569, at p 574 that, "the view that the sphere of industrialism is to be found in operations in which the relation of employer and employee subsists is also, in our opinion, too wide: it approaches the economic view, and would bring within the range of the industrial power of the Commonwealth services of all kinds whatever. It cannot, we think, be supported, for it ignores the use of the word 'industrial' in the composite expression 'industrial dispute' in the Constitution." (per Knox C.J., Gavan Duffy and Starke JJ.) In the judgment from which this passage is quoted the "economic view" of what "industry" includes is rejected as a guide to what the word means in the Act. (at p601)

13. Griffiths C.J. said in the Jumbunna Case (1908) 6 CLR, at p 333 , " . . . in my judgment, the term 'industry' should be construed as including all forms of employment in which large numbers of persons are employed the sudden cessation of whose work might prejudicially affect the orderly conduct of the ordinary operations of civil life". I do not think that this is a criterion by which credit unions would qualify for inclusion in the expression "industry". (at p601)

14. In the Australian Insurance Staffs' Federation v. Accident Underwriters' Association ; Bank Officials' Association v. Bank of Australasia [1923] HCA 61; (1923) 33 CLR 517 , the Court decided by a majority that a dispute between employers who carry on the business of banking or the business of insurance and their employees engaged in the business as to wages to be paid and the conditions of employment to be observed with respect to such employees is an "industrial dispute" within the meaning of s. 51 (xxxv.) of the Constitution and the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1921. Isaacs J., as he then was, and Rich J., in a joint judgment, said (1923) 33 CLR, at p 527 , that banking and insurance "are indispensable portions of the general industrial mechanism. Without the aid of the capital and credit furnished by bankers the present system of industrial organization would collapse. They directly furnish an essential instrument of production." Higgins J. in a separate judgment, agreed with Isaacs and Rich JJ. and referred to the words of Griffith C.J. quoted above as "carefully weighed words" (1923) 33 CLR, at p 530 . Powers J. also, in a separate judgment, agreed that the dispute was "industrial" and stated that, "(s)urely a cessation of the banks' operations would come within" the words of Griffith C.J. (1923) 33 CLR, at p 534 . Powers J. added, "(t)he cessation of insurance business would at once cause an increase in the cost of building operations and in the price of goods and materials for other industrial occupations if the employers had to bear individually the risk of loss by fire and otherwise". (1923) 33 CLR, at p 535 Starke J. said in his judgment that, "(t)he functions of insurance and banking simply constitute the financial side of the industrial system, and are attendant upon its directly productive and distributive activities". (1923) 33 CLR, at p 536 (at p602)

15. The proofs before the Court with respect to credit unions do not, in my opinion, establish that they carry on the business of banking. In my opinion the considerations upon which the Court decided in the last mentioned case that an "industrial dispute" existed between the employer and the employees do not apply in the present case. (at p602)

16. The book, Credit Unions in the South Pacific, edited by N. Runcie, which was tendered at the hearing before the Industrial Registrar and was received in evidence at the hearing before us in the present matter provides an account of credit unions, their organization, aims and objects, the service they perform for their members, and the conditions on which the services are rendered, which in my opinion, is not reconcilable with the concept of "industry" which formed the basis of the decision in the Australian Insurance Staffs' and Bank Officials' Case [1923] HCA 61; (1923) 33 CLR 517 . (at p602)

17. Credit unions were founded by people of small means who pooled their savings and out of the fund thus created made loans to members at the lowest possible interest rates - their motive was not profit but mutual helpfulness. The main functions of credit unions are still to provide low interest loans for consumer purposes to members, and generally help members manage their money - to teach thrift. People also save in a credit union to pay their bills and accounts, for example, rates on a house, insurance and registration on a motor car, medical expenses. The motto of the movement is, to quote from Runcie's book, "Save Regularly, Borrow Wisely, Repay Promptly". With a view to fulfilling its objects, a credit union, no doubt, would carry on its business profitably, but the governing principle is still mutual helpfulness. By a system of insurance many credit unions operate on the "debt dies with the debtor" principle - see Runcie's book at p. 31. According to evidence, credit unions provide only a minute portion of the loan capital generated in Australia. (at p603)

18. In Pitfield v. Franki [1970] HCA 37; (1970) 123 CLR 448, at p 458 Barwick C.J. said, "it cannot properly be said, in my opinion, that the services of the fire fighting authorities are incidental to the industrial activity of the industrial section of the community in the same sense that banking and insurance have been said to be industrial. They are certainly not necessarily or indispensably so, however important the protection of industrial assets may be. It cannot properly be said of them that 'they are indispensable portions of the general industrial mechanism' per Isaacs and Rich JJ. in Australian Insurance Staffs' and Bank Officials' Case (1923) 33 CLR, at p 527 ." Furthermore, the Chief Justice said, "The work of the fire fighter is not productive of commodities nor is it instrumental in their distribution" [1970] HCA 37; (1970) 123 CLR 448, at p 458 . Consequently his Honour arrived at the conclusion that the work of a "fire fighter" is not "industrial". Much that is said in these passages is contrary to the view that "industry" comprehends credit unions. (at p603)

19. The expression "credit unions" is defined in Websters' Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, unabridged, as follows - "A co-operative association that makes small loans to its members at low interest rates." Having regard to the state of the authorities I am not prepared to hold that such a body is an "industry" and I do not think that essentially it is. (at p603)

20. In my opinion certiorari should issue. (at p603)

The question submitted in the case stated is whether by virtue of the provisions of the Estate Duty Assessment Act 1914-1928 the policies mentioned in the case or their proceeds are deemed to be part of the estate of James Frederick Maslin deceased for the purposes of the Act.

James Frederick Maslin died on 11th January 1940. He was survived by his wife Alice Thornton Maslin.

By deed dated 30th January 1925 the deceased settled two policies of insurance effected on his life and their proceeds and thereby directed the trustee to hold the same upon trust for his wife for an absolute interest with a proviso that if she predeceased him the policies should be held by the trustee upon trust for himself. Mr. Alroy Cohen on behalf of the commissioner submitted that the proceeds of the policies are part of the estate of the deceased for the purposes of duty under the Federal Estate Duty Assessment Act 1914-1928, basing his contention on two grounds.

In the first place he said that the settlement contained an interest in the policies for the life of the settlor within the meaning of sec. 8 (4) (c) of the Act. In my opinion this is unsound. The only interest which the deceased had depended upon his surviving his wife, and this was not an interest of any kind for his life. The only life mentioned in the settlement was that of his wife, but even she did not have an interest of any kind for life. Her interest was an absolute interest with an executory gift over to the settlor absolutely in the event of her death in his lifetime. No life estate of any kind was therefore created by the deed.

In the next place he argued that the settlor had a beneficial interest in the policies or their proceeds which passed by virtue of the settlement after his decease to his wife (sec. 8, sub-sec. 4 (e)). But it is plain that his wife did not acquire any new interest on his death. Her interest was created at the date of the deed, and although his death caused that interest to become indefeasible it did not bring into existence any new estate (Bakewell v. Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (S.A.)[1]; Commissioner of Succession Duties (S.A.) v. Isbister[2]).

In my opinion the answer to the question should be: No.

$$$

I agree that the demurrers in each case should be allowed.

Section 13A did, in my opinion, upon its true construction authorize the Governor-General to make reg. 7 of the National Security (Aliens Service) Regulations (Statutory Rules 1942 No. 39) and Part II. of the National Security (Aliens Service) Regulations (Statutory Rules 1943 No. 108).

These regulations provide for the compulsory enrolment of aliens in the armed forces organized by the Commonwealth to wage war against its external enemies. This enrolment of aliens is not permissible by the rules of international law, as propounded in works of high authority, governing the responsibilities of aliens for the defence of the State in which they are resident: See Hall, Treatise on International Law, 8th ed. (1924), p. 260.

There is a presumption that the legislature does not intend to violate by a statute any established rule of international law. But the presumption does not govern the construction of a statute if its language shows that it was not the intention of the legislature that the statute should be in harmony with international law: See Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 7th ed. (1929), pp. 127, 131. I think that the presumption does not apply here. The general term "persons", used in s. 13A, plainly includes at least aliens within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, besides persons other than aliens. In this context, the word "persons" does not reasonably admit of being narrowed in construction to mean only persons other than aliens.

It was also argued that, upon this construction of s. 13A, the section is beyond the legislative powers of the Commonwealth. I cannot agree with this argument. Subject to the Constitution, the legislative powers under s. 51 (vi.) to make a law answering the description of a law with respect to "defence" is plenary. The power is not subject to the rules of international law governing the responsibilities of aliens for the defence of the State in whose territory they are resident (Farey v. Burvett[10]; Amalgamated Society of Engineers v. Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd. (Engineers' Case)[11]; Hodge v. The Queen[12]).

I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.

The question in this case arises upon s. 249 (1) of the Local Government Act 1928 Vict.. The provision says that all land shall be ratable property within the meaning of that Act except land the property of His Majesty which is unoccupied or used for public purposes.

The appellant is constituted by the Grain Elevators Act 1934 Vict.. By this legislation it is made a corporation and is made capable in law of, inter alia, purchasing and holding real and personal property for the purposes of the Act. The question in the case is whether certain land which the appellant purchased and of which it has been at all material times the registered proprietor is land the property of His Majesty which is used for public purposes. If such land is within that description it is not ratable. The appellant claims that while the land in question is at law its property, the land is in equity the property of the Crown. The words "land the property of" the Crown in s. 249 (1) include land which is the equitable property of the Crown. Hence if the appellant's claim is substantiated, the land in question is not ratable.

Section 4 (3) of the Grain Elevators Act 1934 creates a capacity in the Board to purchase or hold land only "for the purposes of the Act and subject to the Act." Hence the appellant Board holds the land now in question for those purposes and subject to those provisions. Does this make the Board a trustee for the Crown? I do not repeat the provisions of the Acts. The powers and duties given to the Board are directed to supplying the public with the service of handling grain in bulk by means of the elevator system. The Acts entrust the responsibility of carrying on this service to the Board. Under the Acts, the Board is subject to a measure of control by the Executive Government. This control is a check upon the Board in the exercise of its powers and duties. But the result of the control is not that the Board is the servant or agent of the Crown or that the service of bulk handling of grain is made a function of the Crown. It is not a tenable view that the purposes for which the Board holds the land in question under the Acts are the purposes of the Crown, or that the effect of the Acts is to make the Board a trustee of the land for the Crown.

In my opinion the appellant's claim that the land in question is the property of His Majesty fails.

This appeal arises out of an award, stated in the form of a special case for the opinion of the Court, in pursuance of s. 9 (a) of the Arbitration Act 1902 N.S.W., upon questions of law. I do not repeat the facts found by the arbitrator and the question of law submitted by him.

As regard Question 1 (a), it is clear that the intention of reg. 14 (1) (a) is to prohibit the termination of the employment in a protected undertaking of any person employed therein, save with the prescribed permission. The violation of this prohibition is punishable as an offence against the National Security Act 1939-1943, s. 10. A court will not lend its aid to give any effect to an act done in breach of the regulation. Such an act can have no effect upon the contractual relationship between the employer guilty of the breach and the employee in respect of whose employment the breach is committed: See Whiteman v. Sadler[76]; Cope v. Rowlands[77]. By the letter dated 29th September 1944, the appellants purported to terminate the respondent's existing employment in their undertaking. The sending of that letter was a contravention of the regulation. The answer to the question, whether this purported dismissal was "ineffectual in law" to terminate the respondent's employment as general manager, should in my opinion be: Yes. The arbitrator states in the special case what his award is if Question 1 (a) is answered in the affirmative. The question whether, if Question 1 (a) is thus answered, the award is right, is not submitted by the arbitrator. This award decides that the respondent ceased to be general manager on 19th September 1945 and that certain amounts are due to the respondent for salary and other remuneration respectively from 29th September 1944 to 19th September 1945; also a sum by way of damages for the wrongful dismissal of the respondent on 19th September 1945. The regulation having ceased to apply to the appellants' undertaking, he was excluded from it on that date. If the regulation had not been in force on 29th September 1944, the dismissal of the respondent from the employment of general manager, although made in breach of the contract of employment, would have been effective at common law to terminate the respondent's service as general manager and the remedies of a servant for wrongful dismissal would have been available to the respondent.

It was a term of the agreement that the respondent was to receive payment as consideration for his services and the performance of his part of the agreement. The facts of the present case are peculiar. It appears that although the appellants purported to terminate the respondent's employment as general manager, he attended their office from 29th September 1944 down to 15th September 1945 and performed work previously done by him as general manager; the respondent did not acquiesce in his dismissal; and after 29th September 1944 he did not receive any payment from the appellants.

If the appellants had not purported to dismiss the respondent he would have been entitled to be paid for such attendance and work the consideration which the appellants agreed to pay him for his work as general manager. The termination of his employment as general manager being illegal and void, the appellants cannot rely upon it to relieve themselves from liability to pay the respondent the salary and remuneration which the arbitrator says he awards if Question 1 (a) is answered yes.

If the respondent had not attended the undertaking after the illegal termination of his employment on 29th September 1944, I should doubt whether the cases of George v. Mitchell & King Ltd.[78] and Adrema Ltd. v. Jenkinson[79] would establish that the appellants' liability to pay salary or other remuneration continued after 29th September 1944.

In regard to Questions 1 (b) and 2, it is apparent from the terms of the special case that if Question 1 (a) is answered: Yes, these questions do not arise.

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

As I am differing from the ultimate conclusion arrived at by the learned primary Judge, I shall state my reasons for so doing very briefly.
At the outset it is "essential to ascertain that there was a legal duty, and a breach thereof, before a party is made liable by reason of negligence" (Marfell v. South Wales Railway Co.[73]). No express statutory obligation relevant to this case having been suggested, it has to be determined upon the common law principles which were recognized, collected and formulated in Indermaur v. Dames[74]. That case has been frequently considered and recognized, but always regarded as unimpeachable. Brackley v. Midland Railway[75] is a very recent case which interprets the law as stated in Indermaur v. Dames[76] with reference to a case like the present, where the final result turns on the knowledge of the person who has suffered injury from the defective condition of the premises. That case adopts Lord Atkinson's statement as to knowledge in Cavalier v. Pope[77], and the decision is based on that statement. The present Lord Chancellor, in Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Procter[78], is clearly of the same opinion as Lord Atkinson. I see no reason for doubting the accuracy of those opinions; and all I think necessary to do in this case is to see how far the appellant's knowledge relieved the respondent of any duty to protect him.
I think it should be said here, as the Master of the Rolls said in Glasscock v. London, Tilbury & Southend Railway Co.[79], that the plaintiff went "frequently to the station, but it was quite possible for persons to use a station every day without knowing at what exact spot the platform came to an end." I think that the condition of the station and the want of light, such light momentarily lessening, and the uncertain position of the edge of the platform, created a state of affairs that imposed a duty on the respondent to protect the appellant by lighting up the platform. That duty was neglected, and, no contributory negligence being properly chargeable to the appellant, the respondent's liability is established.
Poole J. has expressly found that the maxim Volenti non fit injuria does not touch the appellant. If that is necessary, the appellant has the benefit of the finding. But I do not see that it is necessary.
No question arises as to the damages which are settled by the learned primary Judge. I therefore think judgment should be entered for the appellant for the sum so found.

DIXON J. delivered the following written judgment:-
These are two suits in the Admiralty jurisdiction of the Court. The salvage services rendered by the plaintiffs to the defendant ship Mill Hill and her cargo. The services are said to have been rendered by the steam tug Foremost and the plaintiffs in the first suit are her owners and in the second suit her master and crew. It appears from affidavits that Mill Hill had loaded a cargo of pig iron at Whyalla and was westward bound across the Great Australian Bight when, on 19th August 1950, she got into difficulties. She encountered bad weather and her cargo shifted. She was at the eastern end of the Bight south or south-west of Cape Radstock. About 5 p.m. on 19th August, a Saturday, she wirelessed for urgent assistance. Eventually she anchored approximately four miles off Cape Radstock. There a west-bound tramp steamer Culross went to assist her. She stood by from about 2 a.m. until dawn on Sunday, 20th August, and then took off the master and crew from Mill Hill. In the meantime the agents in Adelaide of Mill Hill had been informed of her wireless message or messages asking for assistance. In the course of Saturday evening they arranged with the agents of the plaintiffs, Huddart Parker Ltd., that their tug Foremost should be sent early next morning to the assistance of Mill Hill. It was orally agreed that the form of agreement commonly used by the plaintiffs, Huddart Parker Ltd., should be signed. Subsequently such a form of agreement was signed and dated as of 19th August 1950. The applications of which I have now to dispose depend upon provisions of this agreement, but, before dealing with its terms, it is better to complete the statement of the events. The tug Foremost left Port Adelaide about 4 a.m. on Sunday, 20th August, and sighted Culross about one o'clock on the morning of 21st August or a little before that hour. After an exchange of signals about the possibility of transferring the master and crew of Mill Hill from Culross to the tug, Culross proceeded to Adelaide with the master and crew, and the tug, under instructions obtained by wireless, continued her course to the abandoned ship Mill Hill, which she reached about 5.15 p.m. on Monday, 21st August 1950. A heavy S.W. swell is said to have been running which, with a moderate S.E. wind, made the boarding of the heavily listed ship a matter of difficulty or hazard. It was found necessary to cut Mill Hill's anchor chain adrift and to do this took some hours. Not long before midnight, however, she was freed and a towing wire was passed aboard and made fast. The tug then began a tow towards Sceale's Bay, which is northerly from Cape Radstock. Another tug arrived about 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 22nd August, and, after some difficulties which it is unnecessary to recount, Mill Hill was brought into Port Lincoln in Spencer Gulf on the morning of 25th August, where she was safely moored. On 7th September 1950 Huddart Parker Ltd. issued a writ in rem out of the Principal Registry against Mill Hill and her cargo and obtained a warrant for her arrest, which was duly executed. An appearance was entered in the Principal Registry for the ship and her cargo on 25th September 1950 and four days later, without taking any further step in the suit, the defendants applied by summons for an order that all proceedings in the suit be stayed pursuant to s. 5 of the Arbitration Act 1928 (Vict.). On 12th September 1950 the plaintiffs the master and crew of the tug Foremost issued a writ in rem out of the Principal Registry against the ship Mill Hill and her cargo, but a warrant for her arrest was not sought in that suit. The defendants appeared in the same Registry and made a similar application by summons for a stay. Bail was given in the first suit and the ship and her cargo were released. The basis of these applications consists in a provision in the form of agreement signed by the agents of the tug-owners and the agents of the ship Mill Hill. The defendants say that the provision amounts to a submission to arbitration which covers the subject matter of the suits. The agreement itself is designed to give the tug a salvage reward if the ship is brought to port, or her safety is otherwise secured, by or with the assistance of the tug, but in the contrary event to give the tug a remuneration by way of hire calculated at so much an hour. The agreement provides when the period of service, in that event, shall commence and end, what addition there shall be to the hire rate, if the crew are necessarily paid increased rates, what charge shall be made for the use of the tug's hawser, and what shall be the minimum charge for the services of the tug. The agreement is expressed to be between the plaintiffs, Huddart Parker Ltd., who are described as "the company," and the agents "on behalf of the owners of the ship Mill Hill and as agents for the said ship and her cargo and freight." The leading provision is to the effect that the company's tug Foremost was thereby engaged to proceed from Port Adelaide and to endeavour to salve or assist the ship Mill Hill described as being then in a position approximately four miles off Cape Radstock, South Australia. Then follows a provision that if the ship should be brought to port or her safety otherwise secured by or with the assistance of the tug, the services of the tug should be remunerated on a salvage basis and in ascertaining the amount of such remuneration no regard should be paid to certain clauses which ensue dealing with the remuneration of the tug in the contrary event. After incorporating the terms of the company's usual towage contract so as to give the company the benefit of the exemptions from liability the towage contract contains, the agreement ends with the three clauses upon which these applications depend. They are as follows : - "7. If the parties cannot agree upon the amount of salvage remuneration, it shall be submitted to the Admiralty Court in London for decision under the Short Cause Rules or to an Arbitrator in London to be agreed by the parties. 8. For the purposes of the Arbitration the Masters of the ship and the tug shall sign an Agreed Statement of Facts and in so far as they cannot agree, their log book entries and reports shall be submitted to the Arbitrator. The London representatives of the Company and of the ship and/or their respective Legal Advisers may express their views in writing direct to the Arbitrator including their views as to the value of the ship, her cargo and freight. 9. Until satisfactory security has been given, the Company's right of lien over the ship, her cargo and freight for the services rendered, and its right to commence legal proceedings to enforce such lien shall not be affected by this agreement". (at p506)

2. The interpretation of cl. 7 and its relation to cl. 9 perhaps require some consideration. First as between the Admiralty Court in London and an arbitrator in London to which tribunal does cl. 7 mean that the parties must primarily have recourse? I think that it means that the salvage remuneration is to be determined by the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice in London unless the parties agree on an arbitrator in London. Probably under such a provision if the parties fail to agree on an arbitrator the court's power under s. 5 of the Arbitration Act 1889 (U.K.) would not arise. The agreement to refer is conditional upon the parties concurring in the choice of an arbitrator and the course to be followed is appointed, if they do not do so. Next, what operation is to be given to cl. 9 in relation to cl. 7? I think that it was intended that the agreement to proceed in London contained in cl. 7 should not prevent the enforcement of the lien for salvage by proceedings in rem and the arrest of the ship in any jurisdiction to which the plaintiffs might otherwise resort. Probably the intention is that the amount shall be settled in London whether the lien is enforced elsewhere or not. For cl. 7 speaks only of the amount of the salvage remuneration. But to invoke one jurisdiction to enforce the obligation and another to quantify it involves or may involve some difficulty. No doubt if in a given case to which the clauses applied the amount of the salvage reward were first determined in Admiralty in London in an action in personam, it might become desirable afterwards to attempt to enforce it by a proceeding in rem elsewhere. But a contrary order of proceeding involves inconvenience if not difficulty. After all, proceedings in rem form the commencement of a suit, and if it is a claim for salvage that means that the purpose of the suit is the assessment and apportionment of the award resulting in a proper judgment for payment out of the res or perhaps in personam (see per Jeune J. in The Dictator (1892) P 304, at pp 310, 319-323 ). If the amount of the reward has not been ascertained, it is not easy first to invoke the jurisdiction of another court over a salvage claim by proceedings in rem and then to ask that court to stay its hand pending the ascertainment of the amount of the reward in London. The difficulty is not lessened by the fact that the ascertainment of the reward may not necessarily include its apportionment. It is the defendants, however, and not the plaintiffs, who seek the stay in the present cases. Apparently they are content to give bail in this Court and then obtain a stay, while they await the institution and result of proceedings in London. They base their application to this Court on the supposition that as a result of s. 79, or perhaps s. 80, of the Judiciary Act 1903-1948 the Court possesses statutory power to stay proceedings on the ground that there is an agreement to refer them to another tribunal or to arbitration. There is no express statutory power conferred upon this Court to stay, on such a ground, proceedings otherwise properly brought in its original jurisdiction. It is not a power that can arise otherwise than from statute. Section 79 provides that the laws of each State, including the laws relating to procedure, evidence and the competency of witnesses, shall, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth, be binding on all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in that State in all cases to which they are applicable. This section is based on a provision of the law of the United States which has a long and controversial history, originating as it does in the thirty-fourth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789. See for example Camden & Suburban Railway Co. v. Stetson [1900] USSC 81; [1900] USSC 81; (1900) 177 US 172 (44 Law Ed 721) . But s. 79 is more widely expressed than the American provision and I think that it should be interpreted and applied liberally. Notwithstanding the doubts expressed in Lady Carrington Steamship Co. Ltd. v. Commonwealth [1921] HCA 49; (1921) 29 CLR 596 , I should be prepared to regard such a provision as s. 5 of the Victorian Arbitration Act 1928, corresponding to s. 4 of the Arbitration Act 1889 of the United Kingdom, as made applicable to the High Court exercising its federal jurisdiction: cf. Cohen v. Cohen [1929] HCA 15; (1929) 42 CLR 91, at p 99 and Musgrave v. Commonwealth [1936] HCA 80; (1937) 57 CLR 514, at pp 531-532, 543, 547, 548, 551 . But in Admiralty this Court exercises powers given by the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890 of the United Kingdom: see McIlwraith McEacharn Ltd. v. Shell Oil Co. of Australia Ltd. [1945] HCA 11; [1945] HCA 11; (1945) 70 CLR 175, at pp 189, 201, 204, 216 . It is said for the plaintiffs that in exercising these powers so derived the Court does not exercise Federal jurisdiction within the meaning of s. 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903-1948. But however that may be, s. 2 (1) of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890 provides that the Court for the purpose of its jurisdiction as a Colonial Court of Admiralty exercises all the powers which it possesses for the purpose of its other civil jurisdiction. On the view which I take that, in the "other civil jurisdiction" of this Court, s. 79 would operate to confer on this Court the power given by s. 5 of the Arbitration Act 1928 of Victoria to State Courts, the expressions quoted from s. 2 (1) of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890 are enough to make the same power applicable in Admiralty. (at p508)

3. The provision standing as s. 5 of the Victorian Arbitration Act 1928 has been interpreted as covering an agreement referring matters to the jurisdiction of a foreign Court: see per Sir Samuel Evans P. in The Cap Blanco (1913) P 130, at p 135 and the cases cited by his Lordship. It is a result which seems to take little account of the definition of the word "submission" (s. 27 of the Act of the United Kingdom), but it is sufficiently well settled. (at p508)

4. It follows that, in my opinion, this Court has power to stay the suits if, upon a proper exercise of the Court's discretion, it appears that it is a course which should be taken. Under the statutory power expressed in s. 5 of the Arbitration Act 1928 (Vict.) the Court or the judge, assuming that the other necessary conditions are fulfilled, must be satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the submission. This language might appear to place the burden upon the defendants applying for a stay. But the Courts begin with the fact that there is a special contract between the parties to refer, and therefore in the language of Lord Moulton in Bristol Corporation v. John Aird & Co. (1913) AC 241, at p 259 , consider the circumstances of a case with a strong bias in favour of maintaining the special bargain or as Scrutton L.J. said in Metropolitan Tunnel and Public Works Ltd. v. London Electric Railway Co. (1926) Ch 371, at p 389 , "A guiding principle on one side and a very natural and proper one, is that parties who have made a contract should keep it." At the same time, as is shown by the two cases cited, the Court's discretion has not been restricted by any exclusive definition of the circumstances which will warrant a refusal of a stay: see per Lord Parker in Aird's Case (1913) AC, at p 260 , and per Scrutton L.J. in the Metropolitan Tunnel Case (1926) Ch, at pp 389, 390 . (at p509)

5. The circumstances of the present case are unusual. In the first place the primary agreement is to refer the quantum to a Court of Admiralty in London as opposed to other Courts of Admiralty. If I have correctly interpreted cl. 7 of the contract, it is not a question between litigation in court and arbitration out of court. The provision for arbitration out of court is dependent on agreement upon the arbitrator and in effect is not an absolute agreement to refer. It is a question between proceedings in court in London and proceedings in court here. I do not think that cl. 8 of the contract applies to a suit in the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division in London. But perhaps it is desirable to state that it would not in my opinion supply the tribunal to which it does apply with adequate materials for determining and apportioning the salvage reward in the present case. As between an Australian Court and the High Court in London it would, in my opinion, be better to allow the matter to proceed in the Australian Court. All the evidence of what occurred is here, with the exception of any evidence which may come from the officers and crew of Culross. If the matter were tried in London it would be necessary for the more important evidence in the case to be taken on commission. No doubt Mill Hill herself will not remain on this coast, but if the matter is not brought to trial at once, as it well might be, the evidence of her officers and crew can be taken here. There does not appear to me to be any really practical reason for sending this inquiry to London when it can be so much more conveniently and expeditiously conducted here. It is evident that the oral testimony of the master and crew of the tug must be the most important in the case and I should imagine that the matter could better be decided where the Court can hear it tested on viva voce examination and cross-examination. The evidence of the making of the contract will perhaps be uncontradicted or not the subject of contest but that evidence is also here. The conditions in which Mill Hill was left when her master and crew were transferred to Culross form a not immaterial part of the case, but, apart from the Culross altogether, the officers and crew of Mill Hill should be able to establish what those conditions were and their evidence is at present available here. (at p510)

6. Upon these considerations alone I would be prepared to refuse a stay, but there is a further reason or reasons. In the first place, it is dubious how far if at all the cargo-owners are affected by the agreement. Then the plaintiffs, the master and crew of the tug Foremost, contend that the contract between the owners of the tug and the agents for Mill Hill does not operate to prejudice their right to maintain a suit for salvage. The decided cases, of which there are not many, show that some difficulty has been felt in defining the extent to which a shipowner may bind the master and crew of a ship in respect of salvage services she renders. The shipowner cannot bind them by an agreement made with respect to salvage services already rendered: The Inchmaree (1899) P 111, at p 117 ; The Friesland (1904) P 345 . He cannot bind them by a general agreement that his ships will not claim ordinary salvage remuneration for services rendered to ships of an association for insurance purposes to which he belongs and will claim only the value of the assistance settled by a form of arbitration: The Margery (1902) P 157 ; The Alice Richardson 3 Maritime Law Cases Digest 68. ; cf. Leon Blum (1915) P 90, at pp 103, 295, 297 . But in some circumstances the owner has authority to bind the master and crew with respect to the future services of the vessel. In The Margery (1902) P, at p 165 Sir Francis Jeune P. said: - "I am not at all prepared to say that under certain circumstances an agreement made by the owners on behalf of the crew might not bind them, just as an agreement made under certain circumstances by the master may bind the owners. It is clear that if, before the salvage service is rendered, the masters of the two ships meet together, they may make an arrangement by which, subject to the jurisdiction of this Court to see whether it is equitable or not, the masters can undoubtedly bind the owners. I should not be prepared to deny that an agreement made under similar circumstances by the owners on behalf of the master and crew might bind the master and crew; but the reason for that is the necessity of the case. The service has to be rendered on the spur of the moment, and if the agreement cannot be made by the only persons who are there to make it, it cannot be made at all. Therefore ex necessitate an agreement so made binds; but that is a very different thing from saying that, when there is not stress at all, an arrangement made by the owners binds the master and crew, without any notice to the master and crew." (at p511)

7. In The Nasmyth (1885) 10 PD 41 Butt J. held that an agreement made between the masters of the salvaging vessel and the vessel to be salvaged before the services were entered upon did bind the crew of the salvaging vessel as to the amount of the reward. In The Powerful (1860) noted 8 L.T., at p. 335. the Court of Admiralty appears to have held that the master and crew of a steam tug going out to render assistance to a ship were not bound by an agreement made between the agents of the tug-owners and the crews of some luggers employed to accompany the tug. The agreement purported to leave the allotment of salvage earned by the services to the discretion of the agents. (at p511)

8. In the present case I think that in the circumstances that existed on the evening of Saturday, 19th August 1950, it was competent to the owners of the tug to make an agreement for her to render assistance and thereby to bind the master and crew as to the character and amount of the reward. But after consideration I have come to the conclusion that the authority would not extend to such a provision as cl. 7 of the actual contract. That appears to me to go beyond the question of the services to be performed, the conditions governing their performance and the remuneration. It goes to the forum to be available for the assertion of rights in respect of the services and lies outside the scope of any authority that can fairly be implied from the relationship of the master and crew to the owners of the tug and from the exigency or the circumstances: cf. City of Calcutta (1898) 79 LT 517 . (at p511)

9. It would follow that a stay could not be granted in the suit in which the plaintiffs are the master and crew. I think that it would be absurd to have the two suits heard separately, one in London and one here. (at p511)

10. For these reasons I shall dismiss the two summonses for a stay but I shall make the costs costs in the causes. Certify. (at p512)

11. On the summonses for directions I am prepared to make an order for consolidation and for trial without pleadings and to fix an early date for the trial if it is considered urgent. (at p512)

These appeals are from the Full Court of the Supreme Court of

2. The appellant in the first appeal was the defendant in an action in which the respondent as plaintiff sought to make him liable to pay back 15,600 pounds ($31,200) which was part of the deposit which the plaintiff had paid on a sale and purchase of land. The plaintiff was the purchaser and the defendant was the vendor. The action was dismissed. On appeal by the plaintiff the Full Court made an order that judgment be entered for the plaintiff. The amount of the judgment is $31,200. In a cross appeal and in the second appeal the plaintiff complains that the Full Court made no order for the payment of interest. (at p450)

3. As a result of negotiations which Brew commenced, Whitlock agreed to sell and Brew agreed to purchase an area of land at Brighton Beach, Victoria, for the price of 165,000 pounds . A contract of sale was drawn up and Whitlock and Brew signed it. (at p451)

4. The part of the contract headed "Terms and conditions of sale" provided as follows :

    "The purchaser shall pay a deposit of 16,500 pounds of which
    100 pounds shall be paid
    on or before the signing hereof and 16,400 pounds
    within fourteen days from the date hereof and shall pay the
    residue of the purchase money as follows : -
    (a) 39,500 pounds within forty-five days from the date hereof, and
    (b) the balance, namely, 109,000 pounds within twenty years from
    the date hereof."

Clause 5, one of the "special conditions" of the contract, reads thus :

    "Portion of the land sold is used for the sale of petroleum,
    oils and greases and petroleum products of the Shell Co. of
    Australia Limited. The purchaser covenants that he will
    immediately upon taking possession hereunder grant a lease
    of that portion of the land sold as is now used for the sale of
    the abovementioned products to the Shell Co. of Australia
    Limited upon terms that the said land leased as aforesaid be
    used by Shell or their sub-tenant or licensee for the sale of
    such products and upon such reasonable terms as commonly
    govern such a lease. In the event of any dispute between the
    parties as to the interpretation or operation of this clause such
    dispute shall be referred to an arbitrator to be appointed
    failing agreement as to an arbitrator by the President for
    the time being of the Law Institute of Victoria and such
    arbitrators shall arbitrate thereon in accordance with the
    provisions of the Arbitration Act 1958." (at p451)


5. The land was at the time the parties entered into the contract in possession of a company which conducted there a garage and a business of selling motor vehicles. This company held a lease of the land, the term of which was five years from 1st October, 1959. In addition to the activities mentioned the company carried on a petrol filling station on a part of the land in question. This business was carried on subject to an agreement with the Shell Co. of Australia Limited (hereinafter called the Shell Co.) dated 16th November 1957. Under this agreement the petrol filling station was, in effect, to be conducted as an outlet only for Shell products. The lessee company by this agreement covenanted with the Shell Co. that without their consent it would not cease to carry on such business for twenty years. On the same date Whitlock entered into a covenant with the Shell Co. that if at any time default were made by the lessee company in payment of any moneys payable under its agreement with the Shell Co. or in performance of its obligations thereunder, he would pay to the Shell Co. the whole of such moneys and himself perform or cause to be performed the obligations of the lessee company under its agreement with the Shell Co. A condition of the contract between Whitlock and Brew was that :

    "The purchaser shall be entitled to vacant possession of
    the property sold upon acceptance of title and upon payment
    of the sum of 56,000 pounds."

By cl. 4 of the special conditions it was provided :

    "This sale is conditional upon the vendor within ninety
    days from the date hereof being in a position to make title
    to the land sold and give possession thereof. . . ."

The purchaser, Brew, paid a deposit of 15,600 pounds, which is 900 pounds less than the amount stipulated by the "terms and conditions" of the contract : cl. 1 of which is quoted above. He did not pay any other sum due under the contract. The conditions in Table A of the Transfer of Land Act 1958 (Vict.) were applicable by cl. 3 of the "terms and conditions of sale" of the contract. Whitlock in pursuance of his rights under the contract rescinded it and forfeited the sum of 15,600 pounds paid as part of the deposit. Brew sued Whitlock in the Supreme Court of Victoria for the return of the deposit of 15,600 pounds. The grounds of the claim are mentioned in the judgment of the Full Court. The passage reads thus (1967) VR 803, at p 804 :

    "The first was that the contract of sale was uncertain in
    respect of two of the conditions contained in it (conditions 5
    and 6), and it was therefore altogether void, so that there was
    no consideration for the payment of the deposit. The second
    was that, if there were a valid contract of sale, then when the
    vendor purported to rescind the contract for default, his
    action was ineffective to produce a rescission, because the
    notice of default given by him did not conform to the
    requirements
    of the contract, and his attempt to rescind amounted
    to a repudiation which the purchaser accepted, so that the
    contract thereby came to an end. The third was that, if the
    contract were valid and had been effectively rescinded by the
    vendor on account of the purchaser's default, nevertheless
    there were circumstances associated with the purchaser's
    mental health at relevant times which made it just that he
    should be repaid the deposit, and the Court should exercise
    the discretion conferred by s. 49 (2) of the Property Law Act
    1958 to order its return."

The action was tried by Gillard J. who rejected each of these contentions, except that cl. 5 was void. But his Honour decided that this did not invalidate the contract. Accordingly the learned judge gave judgment for Whitlock. Brew appealed to the Full Court against the judgment. As stated above, the appeal was allowed and it was ordered that judgment in the sum of $31,200 (the equivalent of 15,600 pounds) be entered for Brew. The reasons for allowing the appeal depend entirely on the view which their Honours formed on the question of the validity of cl. 5 of the special conditions and its importance to the bargain into which the parties entered. The conclusion they reached is in substance that cl. 5 is void for uncertainty, that the clause is not severable from the rest of the contract, which is therefore wholly invalid, and as a consequence no consideration for the payment of 15,600 pounds moved from Whitlock to Brew and the sum was recoverable as money had and received to the use of Brew. (at p453)

6. Gillard J. had decided that cl. 5 is void for uncertainty but he took the view that the rest of the contract was nevertheless valid. The Full Court concurred in the decision of Gillard J. on cl. 5. Their Honours said (1967) VR, at p 805 :

    "The learned trial judge pointed out that there was missing
    from the provision any specification of the date of
    commencement
    of the term of the lease, the duration of the term, and the
    amount of the rent. In addition there was some evidence that
    the area referred to was unidentifiable. The judge held that
    the provision was too uncertain to take effect. With this
    conclusion we agree, for the reasons which he gave."

It is obvious that the whole matter of the validity of cl. 5 depends upon the construction of the actual words of the clause itself. In my opinion it is not necessary for its validity that the clause should specify in so many words the time of commencement of the proposed lease, its duration or the rent payable if these matters can be inferred from the words of the clause taking into consideration the circumstances which explain the purpose for which the clause was introduced into the contract. It contains a covenant on the part of Brew with Whitlock to grant to the Shell Co. a lease of that portion of the land used at the time of the contract by the lessee company mentioned above for the sale of Shell products. The Shell Co. is not a covenantee. Taking a practical view it is a covenant by Brew with Whitlock to offer a lease as defined by the clause to the Shell Co. No doubt it contemplates that the terms of the lease would be settled by Brew and the company on the basis of what Whitlock and Brew agreed as to the terms of the proposed lease. The obligation of Brew under the clause is expressed to arise on his taking possession. If Brew had gone on with the purchase of the land, the subject matter of the contract, Whitlock would have been able to give him vacant possession of the whole of the land. (at p454)

7. Clause 5 is not uncertain in respect of the portion of the land to which it applies. This would be ascertainable by evidence in case of dispute. The clause requires that the lease should contain terms binding the Shell Co., if it be the lessee, to use the portion of the land to be the subject of the lease for the sale of its products which are mentioned. Of course such terms are not sufficient to constitute a lease. The controversial words of the clause are those which say that the lease is also to be "upon such reasonable terms as commonly govern such a lease". The meaning of the word "lease" is not uncertain. But it cannot be held that the words quoted are sufficient to create a legally enforceable promise to grant a lease to the Shell Co. unless you can gather from such words that Whitlock and Brew had a common intention as to what would be the "terms" of the lease. In order to have a lease there must be, in addition to the parties and property, an ascertainable period for its duration, an ascertainable rent, and an ascertainable point of commencement. On behalf of Brew there is an admission that it can be inferred that the lease which Brew covenanted to grant, if accepted by the Shell Co., would be expressed to commence when Brew went into possession under the contract of sale. If Brew observed the covenant and the Shell Co. entered into a lease with him there would be no interruption in the sale of their products. The question is whether the words quoted are sufficient to indicate a consensus between Whitlock and Brew on the duration of the proposed lease to the Shell Co. and rent. I think we should presume that both Whitlock and Brew had in mind when they made the contract that the Shell Co. took leases of premises and under such leases acquired rights in respect of the sale of its products on the premises and that there were "terms" which were "common" to such leases. As Brew contended the words of the covenant were uncertain, the onus was on him of showing that there were no "terms" which were "common" to leases which the Shell Co. took of premises on which to sell its products, or that the company did not take such leases if that was the case. As regards the duration of the proposed lease, it is clear that the purpose of cl. 5, which must have been as well understood by Brew as Whitlock, was to afford some measure of protection to Whitlock in case he incurred liability to the Shell Co. under the indemnity which is mentioned above. The covenant would serve to require Brew to preserve the exclusive rights which the Shell Co. had enjoyed in respect of the petrol filling station on the land, the maintenance of which was very important to Whitlock by reason of the indemnity. In the light of the circumstances known to both parties surrounding the insertion of cl. 5 in the contract it is right, I think, to draw an inference that it was the common intention of the parties that the duration of the lease would correspond with the unexpired period of the indemnity, which Whitlock gave to the Shell Co., just as it is right to draw an inference that the common intention of the parties was that the proposed lease would commence when Brew went into possession under the contract. I think it is erroneous to hold that cl. 5 is incomplete and void on the ground that it does not mention the date of commencement or the period of duration of the proposed lease. It is enough as between Whitlock and Brew that it can be inferred from the circumstances, which explain the insertion of the covenant in the contract, when and for how long the parties may be presumed to have intended. The word "terms" where secondly used in cl. 5 should, I think, be read to include a term providing for the payment of rent by the Shell Co., because such a term could be assumed without question to be common to the leases referred to. The amount of rent is not mentioned. But it is sufficient to make the covenant certain on this matter that the parties expressly agreed that the amount of rent is to be reasonable. The final sentence of cl. 5 is not part of the covenant. The arbitrator is not to complete the covenant or to supplement any defect in it. That is not the purpose for which the arbitrator is appointed. The thing which he is appointed to do is merely to resolve "any dispute between the parties as to the interpretation or operation of this clause". (at p455)

8. The question whether the covenant to grant a lease to the Shell Co. may be specifically enforced by Whitlock does not arise. It may no doubt be a covenant in respect of which the Court would hesitate to decree specific performance. But I think that there is no such vagueness about the words - "upon such reasonable terms as commonly govern such a lease" - as ought to induce the Court to hold that an action at law cannot be brought by Whitlock against Brew in which such damages as the law would allow could be recovered against him. I would not regard Brew's contention that his covenant under consideration is invalid as "an honest one" (Foley v. Classique Coaches Ltd. (1934) 2 KB 1, at p 7 ). It is obvious that he as well as Whitlock intended it to be effective. In striving to discover the intention of the parties evinced by cl. 5 I have been guided by the well-known statement of Lord Tomlin which is as follows :

    ". . . the problem for a court of construction must always
    be so to balance matters, that without violation of essential
    principle the dealings of men may as far as possible be treated
    as effective, and that the law may not incur the reproach of
    being the destroyer of bargains" : Hillas and Co. Ltd. v.
    Arcos Ltd.
    [1932] UKHL 2; (1932) 147 LT 503, at p 512
    .

In the view which I take that cl. 5 is not invalid it is not necessary to discuss whether the contract could stand without it. (at p456)

9. For these reasons I think that the appeal of Whitlock should be allowed. It follows from this opinion that there is no substance in Brew's cross appeal or in the second appeal. In my opinion both should therefore be dismissed. (at p456)

In my opinion the appeal against the judgment in the first action should be allowed, and the appeal against the judgment in the second action should be dismissed.

The question which arose in the first action was whether the Lieutenant-Governor of the territory acted in excess of his powers by removing the appellant from the office of assistant resident magistrate to that of patrol officer after the Governor-General had declined to approve of the Lieutenant-Governor's decision to suspend the appellant. In the second action the question was whether the Governor-General acted in excess of his powers by summarily dismissing the appellant from the Public Service of the territory.

These questions depend on the Papua Act 1905, the Public Service Ordinance 1907 made under it and the Public Service Regulations 1926 made under the ordinance.

The continuance of the appellant's suspension, which was made under Part VI. of the regulations, depended upon the Governor-General's approval of the suspension. The suspension was made by the Lieutenant-Governor after an inquiry before the Executive Council of the territory. The regulations provide that no officer can be suspended by the Lieutenant-Governor unless such an inquiry is held.

The Governor-General having declined to approve of the appellant's suspension, the Lieutenant-Governor removed him to an office of lower rank than that which he was holding at the time of his suspension. Then the appellant began an action in the Central Court of the Territory of Papua against the territory in which he alleged that his removal was unlawful, and he claimed relief on that footing. The Government of the territory defended the action, but, before trial, reversed the action of which the appellant complained, but without any admission of liability. It would appear that the object which the administration had in retracing its steps was to ensure that, even if the appellant succeeded in the action, he could not rely on the judgment as a title to the office from which he had been removed. The order removing him from the office was cancelled, and he was reinstated. But thereupon the Governor-General dismissed him from the office and the Lieutenant-Governor immediately appointed him to the inferior position to which he had been removed. The appellant met these measures by bringing the second action, in which he claimed relief on the footing that the Governor-General had unlawfully dismissed him. The validity of the order removing the appellant to an inferior position, after the refusal of the Governor-General to confirm his suspension, turns upon the question whether the power of imposing one or other of the punishments specified in clause 14 of reg. 53 was then available to the Lieutenant-Governor. Clause 14 is in these terms: "If upon full inquiry the Executive Council are of opinion that the officer deserves punishment, but not the full penalty of suspension, the Lieutenant-Governor may remove the officer to an office of lower rank in the service, or may require him to serve in his original office at a reduced salary, either permanently or for a stated period, or may deduct a portion of salary due or about to become due to the officer, or may inflict any other punishment allowed by the regulations." It is implicit in this clause that it is upon the inquiry that the Executive Council are to form the opinion whether the officer deserves punishment, and, if they form the opinion that he deserves punishment, whether the punishment is to be suspension or a punishment less than suspension. The terms of the regulations plainly show that this opinion is to be formed before the matter is reported to the Governor-General for his decision. It would not be so reported unless the officer were suspended by the Lieutenant-Governor. The inquiry upon which the Executive Council are to arrive at their conclusion on the question of punishment is identical with the inquiry referred to in clause 8 of reg. 53. The words in that clause, "and no other punishment is awarded," refer to the punishments less than suspension which are specified in clause 14. These words exclude any officer who deserves any such punishment from the rights, in respect of salary, which are preserved to an officer who is not punished at all or whose suspension is not approved by the Governor-General.

In my opinion, the Lieutenant-Governor acted in excess of his powers under Part VI. of the regulations in removing the appellant to the office of patrol officer after the Governor-General had declined to confirm his suspension from the office of assistant resident magistrate.

The question for decision in the second appeal is whether the Governor-General lawfully dismissed the appellant from the Public Service of the territory. Sec. 17 of the Papua Act provides that, unless otherwise provided by law, officers of the territory shall hold their offices during the pleasure of the Governor-General. But, it is contended for the appellant that, since the making of the Public Service Regulations, the Governor-General cannot dismiss an officer otherwise than by approving and confirming a suspension imposed on him by the Lieutenant-Governor. The basis of this contention is that, after the making of the Public Service Regulations, it became a condition upon which an officer held office that he would not be suspended except in the manner provided in the regulations. The regulations do not, in express terms, restrict the Governor-General's power to dismiss an officer at pleasure. They limit the powers of the Lieutenant-Governor, and subject his power of suspension to the control of the Governor-General. In my opinion, the regulations did not impliedly create any restriction on the power of dismissal which the Governor-General enjoys under sec. 17 of the Act.

I agree that the Territory of Papua was the proper defendant.

In the circumstances existing at the time the first action was brought, the appellant was entitled to a judgment granting him appropriate relief with costs, but it is unnecessary to settle the form of the judgment because of the result of the second appeal, which, in my opinion, should be dismissed. There should be no order for costs in either appeal or in either action.

The substantial question raised by this appeal is whether rule 51(1) of the First Schedule of the Commonwealth Air Navigation Regulations is authorized by the provisions of the Air Navigation Act 1920-1936. The Act enables the Governor-General to make regulations for the purpose of carrying out and giving effect to the Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation signed in Paris on 13th October 1919 and the provisions of any amendment of the Convention made under art. 34 thereof and for the purpose of providing for the control of air navigation (a) in relation to trade and commerce with other countries and among the States; and (b) within any territory of the Commonwealth.

Rule 51(1) of the First Schedule of the regulations provides that an aerodyne shall not, except when departing or landing, fly over an aerodrome at a lower height than 2,300 feet. This rule is one of a series of special rules for air traffic on and in the vicinity of aerodromes open to public use. Under the regulations "aerodrome" is defined to include the landing area, neutral zone and building area in a defined ground area used or intended to be used either wholly or in part for the landing or departure of aircraft, and in rule 1 of the First Schedule "landing area" is defined to mean that part of the aerodrome which is reserved for the departure and landing of aircraft. Rule 51(1) seeks to carry out and give effect to the Convention, the relevant provisions of which for the present purpose are clause 39 (a) of annex D to the Convention, which is one of a set of rules relating to "air traffic on and in the vicinity of aerodromes open to public use." Clause 39 provides that "Subject to any special local regulations which may exist: (a) Flight over a landing area at a lower height than 700 metres is prohibited for aerodynes, save in the case of a departure or landing," and in annex A the expression "landing area" means the part of an aerodrome reserved for departures and landings of aircraft. For the applicant it is argued that rule 51(1) cannot be construed as a regulation for the purpose of carrying out and giving effect to the Convention. Though clause 39 (a) of annex D to the Convention to which effect is sought to be given by rule 51(1) prohibits a flight over a landing area at a height lower than a prescribed height, rule 51(1) extends the prohibition to a flight over an aerodrome. The regulation prohibits low flying over a whole aerodrome, whereas the Convention rule relates to a prohibition of low flying over a part thereof, namely, the landing area, but despite its extended operation the regulation is not therefore to be considered as not carrying out the Convention. A regulation which prohibits low flying over an aerodrome is, in my opinion, a not improper method of ensuring a prohibition of low flying over that part of the aerodrome reserved for departures and landings of aircraft and described as the landing area. The word "aerodrome" in the regulation has no doubt a wider meaning than the words "landing area," yet, nevertheless, the prohibition of low flying prescribed by the regulation does, in substance, amount to a prohibition of low flying over the landing area. The object of the statute is to provide by regulations for the carrying out and giving effect to the Convention, and this does not mean that the regulations should be a reproduction of the rules contained in annex D to the Convention. That this was not intended by the parties to the Convention is made clear by a reference to the language of rule 39 set out in annex D. The language of this rule indicates that a strict adherence to the rules of the Convention is not required because rule 39(a) is expressed to be subject to any special regulations which may exist: See also rule 41 of annex D. As sec. 4 of the Air Navigation Act in so far as it empowers the Governor-General to make regulations for the purpose of carrying out and giving effect to the Convention was a valid exercise of the "external affairs power" (See R. v. Burgess; Ex parte Henry[3]), rule 51 (1) should for the reasons I have mentioned be considered authorized by the provisions of the Air Navigation Act.

The appeal should be dismissed and the order nisi discharged with costs.

I agree the defendant is liable for sales tax on the goods mentioned in the special case. The commissioner's claim for sales tax is limited to the period after sec. 3, sub-sec. 4, came into operation and before the amendment made by sec. 6 of the Financial Relief Act 1934.

The first question is whether the articles in respect of which sales tax is claimed are "goods" and are the subject of "manufacture" within the definition of that word contained in sec. 3. The articles consisted of freestone and granite in blocks, which, for the most part, were supplied by a contractor to a building owner in fulfilment of a contract for the erection of a building. In my opinion, in the condition in which they were supplied, the blocks of freestone and granite were commodities and, therefore, fell within the definition of "goods." They were obtained by means amounting to production and, therefore, fell within the definition of "manufacture." Under sec. 3, sub-sec. 4, a person shall be deemed to have sold goods if, in the performance of any contract under which he has received, or is entitled to receive, valuable consideration, he supplies goods the property in which (whether as goods or in some other form) passes, under the terms of the contract, to some other person. The property in the blocks of stone would pass under a building contract at the time they became fixtures, unless the contract contained special conditions under which the property passed to the building owner at an earlier time. Thus it may be taken that, at the time when they were attached to the freehold and became fixtures, there was a sale.

The taxpayer relies on the exemption contained in sec. 20 (1) (g) (i). That exemption is confined to goods being primary products which are derived directly from operations carried on in Australia in mining. It is said that the operation of winning freestone and granite was an operation in mining. The exemption is further restricted by the requirement that the primary products must not have been subject to any process or treatment resulting in an alteration of the form, nature or condition of the goods. Whether the freestone and granite were won by operations in mining or not, I think that, before the property in the stone passed to the building owner and was thus deemed to be sold and after it came into such a condition as to be a commodity, it was subject to a process or treatment resulting in an alteration of its form or condition. The special case shows that freestone was obtained by cutting from open face quarries by means of drilling machines. When blocks were removed from the quarry they were taken to a stonemason's yard and were classified for colour and size and were sawn into sizes suitable for use in the construction of buildings. At that stage, if not before, they became "goods." The blocks of stone were then placed upon the stonemason's bench and, in the majority of cases, worked by the stonemason by means of hammers and chisels into the correct sizes and shapes for setting in positions in the building, that is, the particular building in course of erection. The blocks were then further treated by planing one side, which was then polished by an abrasive stone worked by hand. I think that this subsequent work deprives them of any benefit of the exemption claimed. The granite blocks were similarly treated and disposed of. It too is disqualified from the exemption claimed. The special case, however, does not use terms in describing the treatment of granite and freestone in the yard which completely cover all stone for which exemption is sought. It says that the freestone and granite "in the majority of cases" were worked as I have described. It is, therefore, possible that what I have said does not cover the whole of the goods in question in the case. It may be that in the case of a portion of the freestone and granite the exemption might apply if the operations by which it was obtained come within the description of "mining." But, in my opinion, it cannot be correctly said that the stone was won by "operations in mining." The expression "mining" is a familiar source of difficulty both in England and here. In its primary meaning the word applies to subterranean working. The minerals sought by subterranean working would, no doubt, be highly prized. But it was natural to extend the application of the word "mining" in two directions. If the operations were subterranean, the word was applied to them although the minerals were of no great value. On the other hand, where precious metals or minerals usually won by subterranean working were obtained by excavation which did not include subterranean working, it was natural to describe those operations as mining. In Lord Provost and Magistrates of Glasgow v. Farie[3] Lord Watson says that, although the original meaning of "mine" might be restricted to subterranean excavation it appeared to him to be beyond question that for a very long period that hAs ceased to be its exclusive meaning and that the word has been used in ordinary language to signify, either the mineral substances which are excavated or mined, or the excavations whether subterranean or not from which metallic ores and fossil substances are dug out.

In Australian Slate Quarries Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation[4] the court's answer to the question submitted was, in effect, that open workings for the purpose of winning slate might according to circumstances amount to "mining." It appears to me that the decision does not preclude us from saying that the open workings for the purpose of winning freestone and granite are not mining. On the present special case we are the judges of law and fact, and so far as it is a question of fact, I should feel no hesitation in saying that the winning of the freestone and granite by the workings described is not within the ordinary meaning of mining. The fact is that slate seems to be won at some places by an operation which is one of mining because partly or wholly subterranean. It is easier, therefore, to draw the conclusion that winning slate from an open cut is mining. But winning building stone from ordinary quarries does not, I think, fall within the description "mining." The claim to exemption fails.

This appeal depends upon the meaning and operation of a will made Tasmania, farmer, who died on 9th June 1912. At the time of his death he was seised of two pieces of land upon which he carried on his farming. One consisted of a farm of 1100 acres at Tea Tree; he called it "Cremorne". The other consisted of 100 acres some distance away at Richmond. He left him surviving a widow, three sons and five daughters. Of the three sons one, George Edward Gangell, had married and had children but not long after his father's death, namely on 21st November 1913, he died. He left a widow and four children; the widow and one child have since died. Another son, John James Gangell, married after his father's death. There was only one child of the marriage and he died in childhood on 6th March 1918. John James Gangell's wife died on 3rd January 1942. He did not remarry, and he died on 14th September 1958. The third son of the testator was named William James Gangell. He survived his father and died on 3rd July 1952 but he does not come into the consideration of this case, for the testator, as his will declared, made no provision for William James "he having been provided for by me in my lifetime". (at p121)

2. On the death on 14th September 1958 of John James Gangell it became necessary to make finally a distribution of what remained in the hands of the trustees representing the farm "Cremorne" and the 100 acres. The question who at that date took raised an immediate difficulty. To explain why that was so, it is necessary to turn to the directions contained in the provisions of the will. In the earlier part of his will the testator made bequests to his wife and daughters. He also bequeathed to his two sons George Edward and John James absolutely in equal shares the live and dead stock and farming implements upon his estate known as "Cremorne" and upon his 100 acres at Richmond. Then after certain other dispositions which do not affect the matter, he gave and devised his farm known as "Cremorne" and his one hundred acres to his trustees to the use that his wife should receive a rent charge of 100 pounds a year and be permitted to reside in the homestead on his farm "Cremorne" and that his son John James (who it will be remembered was at that time unmarried) should be entitled to reside there and his son George Edward at his present home (which one may infer was on the estate). The will proceeds "subject to the said rent charge and to the right of my said wife to live on the said farm as aforesaid to the use of my two sons George Edward Gangell and John James Gangell as tenants in common for life". There then follow limitations expectant on the life estate or estates upon the meaning and effect of which the appeal may be said to turn. But before stating these limitations it is convenient to say that they are followed by a direction subjecting the devise of the farm and of the 100 acres to an obligation on the part of the sons to pay for fifteen years an annual payment of 100 pounds to each of his five daughters and to a named son-in-law. As to the daughters the purpose of this annual payment was to enable them to pay off a mortgage to the testator on a certain property of theirs of 1500 pounds. There are further directions about this provision and about other sums advanced to children. Finally the residue of the testator's real and personal property is devised and bequeathed to the trustees upon trust for his wife absolutely. (at p121)

3. Returning to the limitations expectant upon the trust for (or "to the use of" as the will expresses it) the testator's sons George Edward and John James "as tenants in common for life", the will proceeds as follows: "And after the decease of either or both of my said sons in trust for his or their respective widows during their respective lives and after their respective deaths in trust for the children of my said sons George Edward Gangell and John James Gangell upon their respectively attaining the age of twenty-one years". As appears from the facts already stated, George Edward died leaving a widow, who died subsequently, and leaving children who are now living; John James died last, leaving neither widow nor children, his only child and his wife having predeceased him. If on the true interpretation of the will two undivided shares in "Cremorne" and in the 100 acres were created devolving according to the limitations set out above, one to the widow and children of one brother, and the other to the widow and children of the other brother, the result is apparent: the undivided share attributable to John James, upon his death in 1958 must on that footing fall into residue and pass to the estate of the testator's widow and devolve according to her testamentary dispositions whatever they may have been. It must fall into residue because John James left no widow and his child did not attain twenty-one and there is no limitation of that share to any other object: there is none expressed and there is no ground for implying cross-remainders or the like. Turn now to the contrary interpretation of the trusts to take effect after the tenancy in common of the two sons. That interpretation means that the undivided shares do not persist through the limitation of the trusts of "Cremorne" and of the 100 acres and the will is taken to intend that on the death of the last to survive of the two sons and of their respective widows, if any, the entirety of the estate in the lands is to be held in trust for the children of George Edward and John James who attain twenty-one. On that footing it is almost unnecessary to say that the final limitation would be construed as creating a single class who would take per capita and not per stirpes. In the events that happened all would devolve upon the surviving children of George Edward and the estate of any deceased child who had lived to twenty-one. This was the view of the limitation which the Chief Justice of Tasmania adopted. (at p122)

4. An account of the case would be incomplete if nothing was said of a step which in 1929 the parties then claiming under the will took. It is a step which seems to involve the assumption that two undivided shares in the land were created which from beginning to end devolved separately. For the parties so claiming obtained orders partitioning the land. It is not to the point to inquire whether the manner in which the trusts were declared or the interests limited left the remedy of partition available. In fact judicial orders for partition were made and the land constituting "Cremorne" was divided into moieties. As to the 100 acres that land had been sold in 1925 and the proceeds were divided into two equal parts, one part being distributed among the children of George Edward and the other being held by the trustees pending the death of John James. One moiety of the farm "Cremorne" was held by the trustees for the children of George Edward. It was subsequently sold and the proceeds were distributed among those children in equal shares. The other moiety was held by the trustees in trust for John James while he lived and is still held by them pending the ascertainment of the persons entitled thereto under the will in the events that have happened. The operative part of the partition order directed that (upon the division of the land into moieties) one moiety should be allotted as the share of the plaintiffs in the partition suit who were John James Gangell and his wife and the other moiety as the share of the widow of George Edward Gangell (naming her) to be held and enjoyed by them "as their respective moieties in severalty according to such allotments but subject to the trusts and limitation contained and set out in the will". Doubtless the widow of George Edward was named because she was regarded as entitled in possession to the undivided share attributable to him and therefore to the corresponding divided share in severalty. In the same way John James and his wife were named as entitled (doubtless in succession) to the other share in severalty. But in the result that divided half share was in fact dealt with as held in severalty and its proceeds were distributed. How the other divided half share stood might perhaps seem almost to be determined by the order although it mentioned only the widow, who was then living. However, the words "but subject to the trusts and limitation contained and set out in the will" have been taken to remit the question of the devolution of that half share to the terms of the will, notwithstanding the partition and the order or orders. Perhaps the partition order or orders so intended, but however that may be, it seems proper to deal with the case on the footing that the trusts limited by the will prevail and will govern the destination of the remaining divided share. But is the assumption ill founded that the testator meant the separation into undivided equal shares with which the initial gift to his two sons as tenants in common for life begins to persist and prevail to the end? It is to be noted that the ensuing trust is expressed to arise "after the decease of either or both of my said sons" and the trust so arising is "for his or their respective widows during their respective lives". Surely this must mean that after the death of the first of the sons to die his widow shall take his undivided share and become a tenant in common with her brother-in-law for life. When the brother-in-law died his widow would become the tenant in common for life with her sister-in-law. It is because of the possibility of the latter situation that the words "either or both" are used in the expression "either or both of my said sons". The testator is not contemplating the death of both sons simultaneously but an ultimate situation in which both shall be dead; but because he also contemplated a situation in which one should be dead and the other living he spoke of the alternative. It is poor drafting but to attempt in one form of expression to deal with two parallel limitations applying to the separate devolution of two distinct undivided shares is to set about an operation difficult for any draftsman. The use of the word "respective" may often form a trap because of its inadequacy to maintain a continually repeated distinction and that may well be supposed to be one cause of the present difficulty. But the repetition of this word at least evidences an intention to continue a separation or distinction. There can be no doubt that the "respective widows" are to take in common in equal shares but there can also be no doubt that the title of each will begin at a different time from the other and that time will be her husband's death and that in other words it is expected that it is her husband's share that will devolve upon her. Why it should be supposed that each son will leave a widow does not appear, although the will is expressed as if this assumption were made. But it is a fallacy so to infer. The contingency or condition is implied, "if there be a widow". If not, that step in the devolution is doubtless to be praetermitted. According to ordinary principles, if either or both of the sons had died leaving no widow, the next ensuing interest would be accelerated. In fact John James died leaving no widow but when he died George Edward's widow had predeceased him. Is it a sensible interpretation of the limitations to regard it as involving the possibility of any or every interest being suspended until it is ascertained that all four of the persons mentioned, the two sons and the two possible widows, have died? That is the necessary supposition if we postulate that the words "after their respective deaths in trust for the children" etc. mean that the whole estate of "Cremorne" and the 100 acres are to be kept together until by successive deaths it could at last be said that the two sons are dead and that there is no widow of either of them living. If that were the meaning of the words, in the circumstances which occurred no distribution ought to have been made until the death of John James, for until his death it was quite possible that he would remarry and leave a child or children. It is not necessary to go through all the logical possibilities which existed at the time the will was made but it was manifest that the two sons, George Edward and John James, might have died in any order. One or other or both might have left a widow; neither might have left a widow; one or other or both might have left children or neither might have done so; the children whom they left them surviving might have died before attaining twenty-one or might have attained twenty-one either before or after their father's deaths. In all these cases the suspension between the deaths of the life tenants and the actual ascertainment of the parties to take might have continued for lengthy periods of time on the hypothesis that the ultimate distribution was to be among the sons of both brothers per capita who attained twenty-one. The better reading of the will appears to be that although somewhat clumsily expressed it was intended to leave two separate undivided shares, one to each of George Edward and John James, and that the limitations applied separately to that undivided share so that each undivided share devolved without regard to the destination of the other. In a sense the case may be described as one in which it was necessary to decide whether the ultimate distribution was to be among children per capita or per stirpes. It is true that many analogous cases have been discussed on such a basis. But needless to say the fundamental question must be whether in this will there are limitations of two separate undivided shares remaining separate until the final distribution in the case of each. No doubt how you approach the question is important, and in cases of a like description to begin with a presumption in favour of an ultimate distribution per capita may prove sometimes the deciding factor. But the question must be asked - distribution of what? Does it appear that "Cremorne" as an entirety and the 100 acres as an entirety were to await an event, or the emergence of a situation, that is to say the situation of there being no longer alive George Edward, John James or a widow of either of them, and then and not until then were there to be ascertained the persons for whom the entireties were to be held in trust? If that were so, it would follow that the trust was in favour of children per capita of both brothers provided a child attained twenty-one. (at p125)

5. But I think that a close consideration of the will shows that the contrary appears and that the true intention was that two undivided interests should devolve, the distinction between them being maintained. The nature of the problem is discussed in Sumpton v. Downing [1947] HCA 36; (1947) 75 CLR 76, at pp 88, 89 where cases upon analogous interpretations of wills are referred to. It may be useful to repeat from the judgment of Romer J. in Re Errington (1927) 1 Ch 421 the following: "Where a testator gives the income of his estate to two people, A and B, for their lives and follows that gift by a direction that at their death, or at their deaths, or at or after the death or deaths of A and B the property is to go to their issue, the Court does not construe the gift as a gift only to take effect on the death of both in favour of the issue of both, but construes it as a gift, to take effect on the death of each, of the share to the income of which the deceased was entitled, to the issue of the deceased. So that in the simple cases to which I refer, on the death of A leaving issue, the issue of A would take one-half notwithstanding the fact that B still was living. On the death of B, B's issue in the same way would take the share in which B had a life interest" (1927) 1 Ch, at p 425 . His Lordship was dealing with a will where the succession was to "issue" and as his Lordship held the meaning of that word was not restricted to children. But the point of his statement lies not in that but in the intention to maintain the undivided shares in the succession. In the ill-drawn limitations of the trusts I think that is the intention. I think that the appeal should be allowed, the order of the Supreme Court in so far as it answers question 1(a) in the originating summons and declares that it is unnecessary to answer question 1(d) should be discharged and that it should be declared that the gift which would have vested in the child of John James Gangell had he attained twenty-one years and survived his father falls into residue and is distributable as part of the estate of the widow of the testator. The costs of all parties to the appeal should be subject to the same order as were the costs of the summons. (at p126)

This proceeding is an appeal by a taxpayer from a decision of the Wales. The decision confirmed amended assessments for years of income ended on 30th June 1923 and 30th June of each succeeding year to 1934. The amendments were made on 2nd July 1941, that is, before the Income Tax Management Act 1941 came into operation. (at p308)

2. Having regard to the date of the notices of objection and of the decisions of the commissioner thereon, the Act of 1941 operates in respect of procedure in the proceedings both before the Board of Appeal and in the courts. But the liability of the taxpayer to tax and the measurement of its income is governed by the earlier Acts. As to the years from 30th June 1923 to 30th June 1928, the substantive liability of the taxpayer is governed by the Act of 1912. As to the years 30th June 1928 to 30th June 1934, it is governed by the Act of 1928. (at p308)

3. The taxpayer is incorporated in New York and is registered in New South Wales as a foreign company and at all material times it carried on business here under the direction of a branch manager. During the years under consideration the business consisted of the manufacture and sale of a preparation which is called "Antiphlogistine" and is used in the course of medical treatment. Ingredients for the manufacture of the commodity, or some of them, were imported from the United States of America by this foreign company. Presumably the company was controlled and administered from New York and, at all events, the circumstances are such that its residence for fiscal purposes would no doubt be considered to be abroad. The manufacturing operations were conducted in Sydney. Canvassers were sent to other States of the Commonwealth, but, according to the evidence, with negligible exceptions, no sales were actually made in the other States of the Commonwealth. Not only were nearly all sales made in New South Wales, but deliveries were made either to purchasers in New South Wales or else, I presume, to carriers to whom the goods were entrusted on behalf of the purchasers. (at p308)

4. The result of that would be, speaking in general terms, that all the income of the company arising from its Australian business was derived in or from New South Wales. The Commissioner of Taxation, from a date anterior to 1923, adopted a basis of the assessment of the company's income which did not consist of an attempt to arrive at the general or assessable income or the general income of the company and then to deduct from the assessable income the outgoings incurred in the production of that income. He adopted what may be considered an arbitrary basis of assessment. He took a percentage of the revenue which the company obtained from the sales in Australia of its product. In the years 1923-1928 he took a percentage of five per cent; in the years 1929 to 1931 he took a percentage of seven and one-half per cent; and in the years 1932 to 1934 he reverted to a percentage of five per cent. Up to the year 1923 returns had been made by the company on the footing that all its sales were New South Wales sales and were subject to New South Wales income tax. That meant that on the basis I have described all sales were returned as liable to inclusion in the gross receipts of the company on which the respective percentages were calculated. (at p309)

5. Apparently an arrangement had been made in 1917 with the commissioner to make returns of sales and not of income based on profit and loss. The manager of the branch, a gentleman named Mr. Woodward, unfortunately had a friend named Mr. Wrigley, who was an amateur expert in taxation. The latter made the suggestion that many of the sales of antiphlogistine made to people dwelling in other States might well be excluded from the returns. As a result of this suggestion Mr. Woodward, in his returns for 1923, did not include sales to persons who resided in other States, but confined his returns to sales to persons who resided in New South Wales or who were sufficiently connected with New South Wales to fall outside Mr. Wrigley's opinion of what could be excluded. However, Mr. Woodward who, besides being the manager of the company, was its public officer, did not see fit to communicate this change in the character of his returns to the commissioner and did not divulge to him the alteration in the basis upon which the returns were constructed. (at p309)

6. For the years 1923 and onwards till 1927, that seems to have been done without any communication on the subject from the commissioner or to the commissioner. In December 1928, however, the commissioner, though he did not raise any question, asked that the profit and loss accounts and aggregate balance sheets of the company for the two last years should be furnished to him. The branch manager replied to him questioning whether balance sheets and detailed profit and loss accounts were really necessary. After some delay, the commissioner in March 1929 made a rather formal and peremptory reply saying he needed them and they had to be given. The accounts on which the information could be properly compiled were kept in New York. A communication was made by Mr. Woodward to the New York head office and with a little delay and somewhat grudgingly they supplied him with the information. However, Mr. Woodward decided that, having got the information, it would be better to withhold it from the commissioner which he accordingly did. That was in May 1929. (at p309)

7. Returns continued to go in on the basis which had been adopted in 1923 in consequence of Mr. Wrigley's assistance. It was not until 1941, or perhaps a little earlier, that as a result of what the commissioner learnt, he decided upon an investigation of the matter. The result was that the assessments of the company were ripped up and on 2nd July 1941 amended assessments were issued covering the years I have mentioned, that is, the years ended 30th June 1923 to 1934, together with certain other years with which we are not concerned. (at p310)

8. In these amended assessments the commissioner deserted his percentage of sales basis and adopted the ordinary principles for ascertaining taxable income. That is to say he assessed the income liable to tax by taking what may be called the assessable income of the company, although that phrase did not come into use in the tax laws of New South Wales until 1928, and by deducting therefrom the appropriate outgoings or expenditure. That resulted in a very much larger income being assessed to tax for all relevant years than had been yielded by a percentage of sales. The taxable income ascertained on ordinary principles was not only much greater than an income calculated on a percentage of sales as returned in these years. It was a much larger one than would have resulted had returns been rendered of sales to residents in all the States of the Commonwealth. (at p310)

9. Appeals from the amended assessments were taken to the Board of Appeal by the ordinary method of objection. The Board of Appeal considered the matter and dealt with the questions, first whether any amendment ought to have been made, and second, whether, amendments having been made, the particular amendments made should stand. The decision of the Board of Appeal confirmed the amended assessments. Appeals were brought to the Supreme Court of New South Wales, which confirmed the Board's decision. From the decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales the present appeal was brought to this Court. (at p310)

10. The appeal to the Supreme Court of New South Wales is given by s. 255 of the Income Tax Management Act 1941, which says that a commissioner or taxpayer may, upon taking appropriate proceedings, appeal to the Supreme Court from any decision of the Board which involves questions of law or questions of fact, if in the latter case the Board certifies that the amount of tax in dispute between the taxpayer and the commissioner exceeds the sum of 300 pounds. The appeals are to be heard by a Full Court of the Supreme Court. (at p310)

11. In the present case, the amendments were made under s. 210 of the Act of 1936. Having regard to the period of time that had elapsed, it was necessary that the case should be brought under sub-s. (2) (a) of s. 210, which provides that an amendment may be made at any time "where the Commissioner is of opinion that there has been an avoidance of tax and that the avoidance is due to fraud or evasion." (at p311)

12. The first question for the Board of Appeal was whether the circumstances as I describe them, coupled with some additional detailed evidence which they had before them, warranted the conclusion that the avoidance of tax was due to evasion, and to that question they duly addressed themselves. They concluded that there had been an avoidance of tax due to evasion. For the appellant company it is maintained that the decision of the Board of Appeal on that question is subject to appeal to the Supreme Court. The attack upon the decision is supported on two grounds. The first is that if a discretion lay with the Board of Appeal and it was a discretion which could only be examined to see whether it had been correctly exercised and not to see whether the Board's conclusion itself was right in substance, nevertheless the Board had gone astray and incorrectly applied their minds to the problem. The second ground is that it is not true that under the section the discretion lay with them so that the substantive question could not be re-examined; and the Supreme Court, therefore, had jurisdiction to say for itself whether there had been an avoidance of tax due to evasion and the Supreme Court having that jurisdiction this Court should in the present appeal find that the avoidance of tax was not in fact due to evasion. (at p311)

13. In my opinion s. 210 intends to repose in the commissioner a discretionary power to say whether there has been, in his opinion, an avoidance due to fraud or evasion, and the sections of the Acts of 1936 or 1941 dealing with objections and appeals intend to repose only in the Board of Appeal the authority to re-examine that discretion on the merits. The provisions of the Act substitute the Board of Appeal for the commissioner, once there has been a reference to the Board of Appeal as a result of an objection by the taxpayer to the exercise of the discretion, the objection having been overruled by the commissioner. (at p311)

14. I think that that conclusion is the necessary result of the interpretation which has been given to provisions of the same character as the Income Tax (Management) Act over a period of years. I am alive to the fact that it might have been possible to take a very broad view and say that the ascertainment of taxable income must in all respects be dependent upon opinions, judgments, and conclusions on the part of the commissioner and that it was not very material whether the statute authorizing assessments spoke specifically of his opinion on a particular matter or left it generally to him to ascertain the income of the taxpayer and form a conclusion. In either case the appeal from the assessment made by him might have been considered to cover every matter dependent on his opinion or judgment because the whole assessment represents his determination of the taxpayer's liability and of every matter on which it rests. But in reference to the Federal legislation on which the New South Wales Act of 1928 is based a completely contrary view has been taken from the beginning and there is every indication in the present Act and in the 1936 Act that the New South Wales Parliament intended to legislate in the same sense. Nor does it seem to matter that an appeal from the Board on a question of fact is given. Many questions of fact must necessarily be decided by the Board and s. 238 of the Act of 1941 shows clearly enough that the Board and not the Court is to review opinions and the like given in the exercise of a discretion. (at p312)

15. I do not propose to mention the cases that are dealt with in the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court but a long experience of the manner in which discretionary decisions of the Federal Commissioner and Board of Review are dealt with in this Court would be quite enough to convince one that the gallant enterprise of Dr. Louat, who set out to overcome that practice, was doomed to failure. (at p312)

16. The next question is what is the test to be applied by the Supreme Court in examining the Board's decision to see whether the discretion has been lawfully exercised. In the first place, I think it is quite clear that once there has been an appeal to a Board of Appeal and the Board has expressed its opinion the Supreme Court is no longer concerned with the opinion of the commissioner. If the Board has stated that there has been an avoidance due to evasion it is for the Supreme Court to examine processes by which the Board arrived at that conclusion in order to see whether there has been any error in law or misconception of the Board's duty or any such miscarriage as will show that it cannot stand. (at p312)

17. It is not perhaps either necessary or desirable to attempt to state all the grounds upon which the exercise of discretion by such a body as the Board of Appeal may be invalidated but it has to be borne in mind that the question is whether they have exercised their functions according to law and it is a question of the validity of their conclusion rather than its intrinsic correctness. If the Board has not addressed itself to the question which sub-s. (2) (a) of s. 210 formulates or if the conclusion of the Board is affected by some mistake of law, or if the Board takes some extraneous reason into consideration or if it excludes from consideration some factor which should affect the determination, then I think on those grounds the conclusion of the Board is liable to review in the Supreme Court. (at p313)

18. Again, although it is not this case, the fact that the precise reasons on which the Board acted are not stated and are not known will not prevent the judicial review of their decision. But in such a case it is probably necessary that, on a full consideration of the material which the Board had before it, the Court should be able to say that the decision of the Board could not be explained on any ground which would be consistent with the valid exercise of functions committed to it. That is a broad statement of the considerations which will induce the Court to overturn a discretionary decision by an administrative tribunal. But the recent cases of the Minister of National Revenue v. Wrights' Canadian Ropes Ltd. (1947) AC 109, particularly at pp 122, 123 and Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue (1940) AC 127, particularly at p 136 are two decisions of the Privy Council which provide guidance in such a matter. To those citations I should add a reference to the case mentioned by Williams J., D. R. Fraser & Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue (1949) AC 24 . (at p313)

19. To apply these principles it is necessary to consider what relevant conduct amounts to evasion and whether the Board correctly applied their minds to the question of evasion. I think it is unwise to attempt to define the word "evasion." The context of s. 210 (2) shows that it means more than avoid and also more than a mere withholding of information or the mere furnishing of misleading information. It is probably safe to say that some blameworthy act or omission on the part of the taxpayer or those for whom he is responsible is contemplated. An intention to withhold information lest the commissioner should consider the taxpayer liable to a greater extent than the taxpayer is prepared to concede, is conduct which if the result is to avoid tax would justify finding evasion. (at p313)

20. In the present case the Board concluded that the appellant intentionally omitted the income from the return and that there was no credible explanation before them why he did so. They thought that the conduct of the taxpayer answered the description of an avoidance of tax by evasion. The majority of the Board expressed their conclusion thus by adopting the expressions used by McTiernan J. in Barripp v. Commissioner of Taxation (1941) 6 ATD 69 . That part of their reason seems to me to be a statement which brings the case completely within s. 210 (2) (a) and to state a conclusion which exhibits no error of law and I do not think that what they said prior to announcing that conclusion shows any actual failure to apply the considerations which I have mentioned with reference to what is an evasion. In the formation of the opinion of the Board of Appeal no error of law appears. (at p314)

21. The next point which was made was that, assuming that it was open to the Board to conclude that an amended assessment could be made, nevertheless the amendment which was actually made went beyond the power given by s. 210 to the commissioner, and so beyond the power of the Board, because the amendment was not limited to correcting the assessment so as to overcome the effect of the avoidance and impose a liability for the tax which had been avoided by the evasion. That contention was supported by the view that the commissioner, having adopted the percentage basis initially, could not desert the percentage basis and proceed to amend the assessment so as to ascertain the actual income of the taxpayer by ordinary methods of accounting. On the hypotheses which our decision adopts there had been avoidance of tax because an inadequate account had been given of the sales which had been made, that is to say, sales made in other States had been omitted. It was contended that the commissioner was limited in his amendment to rectifying that position and to including the sales made to residents in other States so that he might obtain the same result as would have existed had returns been made in the year 1923 and the following years on the same basis as had been made in the years 1917 to 1922. In my opinion s. 210 (2) (a) does not limit the commissioner in that manner. Section 210 (2) (a) is a provision which provides that in a case of fraud or evasion there shall be no time bar to the exercise of the power given by s. 210 (1) to amend the assessment. In other words, if there is fraud or evasion its effect is to remove the time bar which exists under the other subsections. (at p314)

22. I am of opinion that, once it is found that in relation to any particular topic there has been fraud or evasion, the commissioner is at liberty to reconsider the whole matter, at all events in relation to everything that is material to the assessment of the tax under the head of liability affected. In this case the whole question was what should be the assessable and taxable income of the taxpayer. The commissioner had considered that and had adopted the view that he might take a percentage of sales. Because of evasion there was an avoidance of liability in relation to the assessable income. It appears to me that, when it was found that that was the case, he was at liberty to reconsider the whole question of how he would ascertain the assessable and taxable income of the taxpayer and he was not limited merely to rectifying the result which would have been produced by a candid use by the taxpayer of the basis which the commissioner had been prepared to adopt. (at p315)

23. It was then said for the appellant company that we should reach the same result by holding that the commissioner is not at liberty by a subsequent use of the sections authorizing amendment of assessments to depart from the opinion which he had formed that a percentage basis was the correct method of assessing the tax. That argument was founded on the sections which, as the appellant asserts, were relied upon by the commissioner for the purpose of assessing the taxpayer on a percentage of sales. In the years 1923 to 1928 s. 18 of the Income Tax (Management) Act 1912 was, it is said, the necessary basis of his taking five per cent on sales. That is not a section the application of which rests on opinion; it is a section which operates on the facts themselves. I do not think it is necessary to examine the provision in detail; it is sufficient to say that, in my opinion, it is inapplicable to the present case. It deals with an agent selling goods in the State of New South Wales on account of a resident out of the State or on account of a foreign company not registered in the State. The present company was registered in the State and I do not think it can be brought within the scope of the section, although no doubt for fiscal purposes it may be considered as a resident of New York. I do not think it can be brought within the application of the provision because properly understood the section is addressed, not to the case of a company carrying on a manufacturing or other business here by means of a branch organized with a manager, officers and servants, but to the case of a company carrying on an undertaking abroad and employing an agent here to sell its goods or enter into transactions in a representative capacity. The distinction is between the company being here and merely being represented by an agent here. (at p315)

24. For the years that follow there are two provisions which are or may be in point. To s. 27 of the Income Tax (Management) Act 1928 there is a proviso which, it is said, was availed of by the commissioner in fixing a percentage of seven and one-half upon the sales for the years 1929 to 1931. In the case of this enactment it is not necessary now to examine its provisions in detail, but having read the section carefully I am disposed to think that that proviso should be construed as a true proviso ought to be construed, that is as something which operates as a qualification upon, and within the general scope of, the main provision of the section. The leading provision says that in the case of any person carrying on business both in and outside the State, income derived from sources within the State shall be determined as follows; and then are set out a number of ways of arriving at a proper apportionment or proper proportion of the income in New South Wales. The first direction relates to cases where the taxable income derived from sources in the State is capable of being kept separate and apart from income derived from sources out of the State. That is the present case. It is a case of a company deriving its business at material times in the manufacture of a commodity and selling it in New South Wales. The proviso contemplates a case in which the necessary information cannot be obtained or one of failing to state the true state of affairs. If the commissioner was satisfied that the necessary information could not be obtained he was wrong. He did not quarrel with the correctness of the information. For the years 1931 to 1934, s. 25 of the Act of 1928 must, it is said, have been applied. That provision again raises some difficulties of interpretation, but it applies to a case where a person in the State acts on behalf of a principal resident or carrying on business out of the State or on behalf of a foreign company. (at p316)

25. Again, I think that in the present case that is not an appropriate section, for reasons which I gave in connection with s. 18 of the Act of 1912. This is a company carrying on business here by its servants. I do not doubt that it is possible that the commissioner did apply those sections, but I do not think that, if he did so, he did so correctly. In any case I would not be prepared to say that if he had applied them, and in the case of ss. 26, 27 and 25 of the 1928 Act, if he had formed a valid opinion in accordance with the provisions they contain, he could not depart from them for the purpose of ascertaining the true taxable income appropriate to the circumstances of this case. The power of amendment in s. 210 appears to me to be sufficient for the purpose. (at p316)

26. That, I think, covers the grounds which are taken and, for the reasons which I have given, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. (at p316)

This is an appeal from so much of the judgment of Hodges, J, dated the 15th August, 1912, as granted an injunction against the defendants to the action, and ordered them to pay the costs of the action. The action was brought by Borsalino Guiseppe E Fratello Societa Anonima, the present respondents, against Thomas Morton Collitt and Herbert Bayford Collitt, the present appellants, and was treated by the parties, and dealt with by His Honour as a passing-off action.
The respondents are a Company incorporated according to the law of Italy, and are large manufacturers of felt hats, which they sell in Australia and elsewhere. The appellants are retail hatters, carrying on business at 103 Swanston St, Melbourne. The respondent Company is the registered proprietor throughout Australia of three trade marks, in which the word "Borsalino" is the distinctive feature. For upwards of fifteen years before this action was brought the respondent Company had imported into Victoria large quantities of hats of its own manufacture. The word "Borsalino" was marked on the leather lining and diagonally across the top of the crown of these hats. During the same period the respondent Company extensively advertised its hats through the medium of mirrors, showcards and catalogues, on which the word "Borsalino" is the conspicuous feature, and stands, with the exception of one kind of showcard, in which the initials of the makers are printed in the margin, isolated and prominent.
At the end of 1908 a firm called G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro and Co, began to import hats of its manufacture into Victoria. These hats were branded in the lining "G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro and Co" This firm also advertised its hats by means of cards, plaques, pictures, etc, which all contained the name of the firm in full.
The defendants, who at the beginning of carrying on business only stocked the respondent Company's hats, had a docket (Ex G 1) written or printed containing the word "Borsalino" and the price. This docket was affixed by the defendants to the respondent Company's hats. In November, 1909, the defendants stocked some of the hats made by the firm of G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro and Co, and affixed the same docket to those hats.
On the 8th September, 23rd November, and the 1st December, 1911, the defendants, on being asked for a Borsalino hat, showed the customers hats of the plaintiffs' manufacture, but in the end sold hats manufactured by the firm of G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro and Co, representing them to be "BorsaliNos" No docket was given by the defendants on the first occasion, but on the two later occasions the dockets (Exs U and X) given to the purchasers stated that the hat sold was a "Borsalino" hat. Thereupon the plaintiffs filed a Statement of Claim, praying, inter alia, for an injunction to restrain the defendants from passing off or attempting to pass off hats marked "G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro & Co," as hats of the plaintiffs' manufacture.
At the hearing, Hodges, J, found that the plaintiffs' hats were well known to both wholesale and retail dealers by the name of "Borsalino," but that "they were known hardly at all to the individual purchaser by that name." His Honour, however, held that the sales to which reference has already been made were "a distinct passing off of the 'G. B. Borsalino' hat as a 'Borsalino' hat," and although finding against a distinct fraud, His Honour found "against the defendants in that they did acts not only calculated to mislead, but acts which did deceive."
On the appeal before this court there was really no dispute as to the law so far as it affected this case. The question resolved itself into one of fact. Mr Irvine, on behalf of the defendants, admitted that it the word "Borsalino," as applied to the plaintiffs' hats, had acquired a secondary meaning and retained it at the dates of the acts complained of, the appeal must fail. He contended, however, that the word had acquired no such meaning, and even if it had, that meaning had become obliterated by the intrusion into the market of the hats manufactured by the firm of G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro and Co, which at the date of the acts complained of had become known equally with the plaintiffs' hats as "Borsalino."
It becomes necessary, therefore, to examine the evidence. On behalf of the plaintiffs, ten persons engagd in the retail trade and four engaged in the wholesale trade were called, who deposed that the plaintiffs' hats were, for eight to fifteen years prior to the hearing, known as "Borsalino" hats, and several of the witnesses stated that if a member of the public asked for a "Borsalino" they would take him to mean a hat which in fact was manufactured by the plaintiffs. The defendants themselves both admit that the plaintiffs' hat was known in the trade as "Borsalino" until the introduction of the hat manufactured by the firm of G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro and Co, but that thereafter to the defendants, contrary to the otherwise invariable usage of the trade, "both hats were Borsalino." Indeed, as already pointed out, the docket (Ex G 1), printed for the defendants to indicate the plaintiffs' hats, was affixed by them to the hats manufactured by the firm of G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro and Co long before these hats could possibly have been known as "Borsalino." This conduct of the defendants, who are indemnified in this action by the firm, is by no means supported by the firm itself.
G. Ferrando, the firm's agent in Victoria, is careful to explain that the firm's hats were advertised and sold as "G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro," in order to avoid confusion with those of the plaintiffs, and that the firm did not claim the right to use the word "Borsalino" alone. Rossi, the firm's agent in New South Wales, although in court, was not called as a witness. Irwin, Ferrando's traveller, admits that the plaintiffs' hats had been known in the market for a long time as "Borsalino," and that at the end of 1909 his firm's hats were being advertised in Messrs. Gliddon and Rowley's shop under the name of G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro, and similarly at the end of 1912 or beginning of 1913 in Messrs. Craig, Williamson and Co's shop.
This witness, at any rate, and by necessary inference Messrs. Gliddon and Rowley and Messrs. Craig, Williamson and Co, had no suspicion that the public called the "G.B." hats "Borsalino." He is emphatic in stating, even at the trial, that it would not be fair to supply wholesale houses with small tickets with "Borsalino" simply on, and gives his reason "Because we do not sell ours as 'Borsalino.'" Richards and Ross also called on behalf of the defendants, distinguish "Borsalino" hats from "G.B." hats. The plaintiffs' evidence, corroborated as it is by the defendants' witnesses, coupled with the answers to interrogatories (Ex F and G), is conclusive proof that the word "Borsalino" had acquired and retained a scondary meaning, which was not confused or obliterated by the trade dealings of the firm G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro and Co.
It would indeed be singular, if Mr Irvine's contention were right, that the advertisements and methods of trade adopted by this firm, in order, as Ferrando states, to prevent confusion, should bring about what was being so carefully guarded against.
The principles of law applicable to this case are stated in the often-cited passage from the judgment of Lord Herschell in Reddaway v Banham, 1896 AC 199 at p 210 
The name of a person, or words forming part of the common stock of language, may become so far associated with the goods of a particular maker that it is capable of proof that the use of them by themselves without explanation or qualification by another manufacturer, would deceive a purchaser into the belief that he was getting the goods of A when he was really getting the goods of B. In a case of this description the mere proof by the plaintiff that the defendant was using a name, word or device which he had adopted to distinguish his goods, would not entitle him to any relief. He could only obtain it by proving further that the defendant was using it under such circumstances or in such manner as to put off his goods as the goods of the plaintiff. If he could succeed in proving this I think he would, on well-established principles, be entitled to an injunction.
It is not necessary that the persons purchasing goods should know of the manufacturer by name, and have in mind when they purchase the goods that they are made by a particular individual. "It seems to me," says Lord Herschell, "that one man may quite well pass off his goods as the goods of another if he passes them off to people who will accept them as the manufacture of another, though they do not know the other at all" Birmingham Vinegar Brewery Company v Powell, 1897 AC 710 at p 715.
Nor does the fact of the defendant bearing the same name as the plaintiff enable him to invade the latter's right of property see Valentine's Case, 17 R P C. 673, per Collins, LJ, at p 679, and Lord Alverstone, M.R , at p 681; see also Brinsmead's Case, 30 R P C. 137. The present case is still stronger, for the defendants' name is not "Borsalino," and they have shown no authority from G. B. Borsalino fu Lazzaro and Co to use the simple name "Borsalino."
Mr Irvine contended that it would be difficult for a proper name, especially of the manufacturer of the goods, to acquire a secondary meaning; but Lord Halsbury, in the Electromobile Co Ltd v British Electromobile Co Ltd, 25 R P C. at p 153, points out that the simpler the title, and the more ordinary the words used, the more difficult the plaintiff's case is. Millington v Fox, 3 My. & Cr. 338, was an instance of the plaintiff's exclusive right to his own name as a trade name, apart from fraud see p 352.
Careful consideration of the evidence, which does not depend on the veracity and demeanour of witnesses, leads to the conclusion that the word "Borsalino," which at first was naturally used as a surname, acquired and retained, at all events in Victoria, a secondary meaning denoting the hats manufactured by the plaintiffs.
For these reasons, we are of opinion that the orders made by the learned Judge are right, and this appeal fails.

This is an application to make absolute an order nisi granted by the Chief Justice calling upon the respondent Bridget Hunt to show cause before this Full Court why an order made on 8th July 1943 by a police magistrate in Victoria dismissing an information laid by the appellant against the respondent under reg. 29 of the National Security (Prices) Regulations and averring that the respondent contravened the said regulation in that she sold at a hotel at Collingwood within a radius of twenty miles from the General Post Office Melbourne one bottle of Corio Special Whisky being declared goods by reason of Declaration No. 96 made by the Minister of State for Trade and Customs on 13th April 1942 and published in the Commonwealth Gazette on 15th April 1942 at a price of two pounds, being greater than the price of 12s. 9d. per bottle which was the price set out for one bottle of Corio Special Whisky in the amended retail price list issued by the Victorian Associated Brewers as operating on and after 1st December 1942 which was by virtue of the terms and conditions of Prices Regulation Orders Nos. 911 and 937 made by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner on 19th January and 5th February 1943 respectively and published in the Commonwealth Government Gazettes on 26th January and 9th February 1943 and numbered respectively 19 and 30, the maximum price fixed in relation to the said bottle of whisky under the Regulations aforesaid for the sale of the same should not be reviewed on the ground that the magistrate was wrong in holding that Prices Regulation Orders Nos. 911 and 937 were not valid price-fixing orders under the National Security (Prices) Regulations.

The evidence is clear that the respondent sold a bottle of Corio Special Whisky above the fixed price, so that the only question that arises is whether the magistrate was right in dismissing the information because the price was not fixed as required by reg. 23 (1) (a) of the National Security (Prices) Regulations. This regulation, so far as material, empowers the Commissioner with respect to any declared goods by order published in the Gazette to fix and declare the maximum price at which any such goods may be sold. With respect to the whisky, the subject matter of the present prosecution, the Commissioner by Prices Regulation Order No. 911 as amended fixed and declared the maximum price at which spirituous liquors might be sold by retail in the Melbourne metropolitan area to be those set out in the amended retail price list issued by the Victorian Associated Brewers as operating on and after 1st December 1942. This is not in my opinion compliance with the regulation. The regulation requires that the price shall be fixed and declared by an order which is published in the Gazette. The Order published in the Gazette in the present case does not fix or declare any price. The price is fixed and declared by the list issued by the Victorian Associated Brewers. I consider that the price must be fixed and declared in the body of the order itself or in a schedule to the order and cannot be fixed by some extraneous document which is not part and parcel of the order.

Mr. Teece referred the Court to the decision of the Full Court of New South Wales in McIver v. Allen[1] and pointed out that if we were of opinion that the Order did comply with the regulation a question would arise whether the Order was of a legislative or executive character within the meaning of the National Security Act 1939-1940, s. 5 (4), which requires that orders of a legislative character must be laid before each House of Parliament. The Supreme Court appears to have taken the view that orders fixing prices are of a legislative character. As the present Order does not comply with reg. 23, this further question does not arise for decision, but as at present advised I think that such orders are executive in character and so must not be taken to agree with the decision of the Supreme Court on this point.

For these reasons I think the application should be dismissed.

I am of the opinion that the transaction between the first appellant's predecessors in title and the second respondent was not a contract for the sale of goods. The slate the subject matter of the transaction was, on the evidence, part of the land where it was deposited. The effect of the evidence is that by the transaction the second respondent bought a mass of pieces of the earth's crust, mined from the quarry in the vicinity, which the quarrying company returned to the earth. As the vendors entered into the transaction for value, it created a valid equitable profit a prendre. The next transaction between the second respondent and the first respondent was not an assignment of the whole of his interest by the former to the latter. This transaction purported to be a sale of what then remained of the mass of pieces of slate but the second respondent did not assign to the first respondent the licence to go on the land to win the slate and take it away. It would seem that an object of the agreement which the first respondent made with the first appellant, who then owned the land where the slate was deposited, was that the first respondent should obtain from the first appellant an authority to go on the land for the above-mentioned purpose. This agreement, if enforceable in a court of equity, is effective to give such authority. However, counsel for the respondents declined in argument to rely upon the agreement except as evidence that the first appellant knew before she paid for the land that the first respondent had purchased the heap of slate from the second respondent. Counsel also relied for this purpose on evidence showing that the second appellant in the course of his authority as the first appellant's agent obtained knowledge of the first respondent's interest in the heap of slate. The reason why counsel for the respondents declines to rely upon the agreement to support the first respondent's claim that he has authority to go on to the land and take away slate from the heap is that the appellants' counsel desires to contest the issue whether the agreement is specifically enforceable and that he had no opportunity of doing so at the trial because the respondents did not plead the agreement, nor was the issue contested whether the agreement supported the first respondent's claim that he had lawful authority to go on the land to win and carry away any slate from the heap. I think that it would be right to allow the application of the appellants' counsel for a direction that a trial of the issue be had and to make an order allowing this appeal. Consequently I would make an order setting aside the order of the learned trial judge and that both the appellants and the respondents should have leave to raise the relevant issues in relation to the agreement of 23rd January 1961. Further, that the respondents should pay the appellants' costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and to this Court and the costs of the suit should abide the order of the judge who disposes of the suit. (at p76)

KITTO J. The respondents' claim for a declaration that the slate in the mound is the property of Stokman and for relief upon that basis was, in my opinion, rightly dismissed by Myers J. upon the ground that the whole mound is part of the land and therefore the property of the appellant Daphne Mills. It may be right to conclude that the materials forming the mound became personality upon being dug up and were later re-incorporated into the soil by being dumped on the land with the intention (to be inferred from the evidence, exiguous though it is) of being abandoned so as to become a permanent accretion to the surface. On the other hand the right conclusion may be that the materials were never so severed from the soil as to be converted into personality. I should myself be inclined to favour the latter view on the ground that there is an element of intention in severance, just as there is in the kind of attachment which makes a chattel part of the realty, and that the proper inference from the known facts is that the company that worked the quarry and built the dump did not have the requisite intention of permanent severance with respect to anything but so much of the slate as it carried away. (at p76)

2. As regards the portion of the mound which is upon land under common law title - and that is the greater part of it - I agree with the Chief Justice in thinking that upon the evidence it should be held that Daphne Mills acquired the legal estate with notice of an equitable interest, created in favour of the respondent Warren by the agreement of 14th November 1955 and enuring for the benefit of the respondent Stokman by virtue of the agreement of 19th February 1960. The intendment appearing from the first agreement is that Warren should have a right to enter upon the land and remove the slate so as to acquire the beneficial ownership of it, and that the right should not be defeasible by any action on the part of the vendors: cf. Fitzgerald v. Firbank (1897) 2 Ch 96 . This was plainly an intention to create a right not only as against the vendors but as against all the world, for it was conferred without any specified limit of time (though perhaps impliedly limited to a reasonable time: cf. Reid v. Moreland Timber Co. Pty. Ltd. [1946] HCA 48; (1946) 73 CLR 1, at p 13 ), and was in aid of what the parties joined in describing as an absolute sale of the slate. The agreed price having been paid, the result, on the footing that the slate was part of the soil, was that, although for want of a deed the only rights which resulted at law were rights enforceable against the vendors personally, the agreement was specifically enforceable and Warren therefore acquired in the contemplation of equity the rights and the interest in the land which a grant by deed in conformity with the agreement would have given him: Mason v. Clarke (1955) AC 778 . That is to say he acquired an interest in the nature of a profit a prendre, an irrevocable licence coupled with an interest and therefore binding not only upon the vendors but upon anyone taking the land from them with notice: In re Refund of Dues under Timber Regulations (1935) AC 184, at p 193 ; Reid v. Moreland Timber Co. Pty. Ltd. (1946) 73 CLR, at p 16 . The opposite view, which was accepted in the Court of Appeal, namely that by reference to the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act it should be held that the effect was to make the slate goods for relevant purposes, is, I think, not sustainable. I content myself with referring on this point to the reasons of the Chief Justice and to the case of Stratford (H. M. Inspector of Taxes) v. Mole and Lea (1941) 24 Tax Cas 20 . (at p77)

3. The rights of entry and removal thus conferred upon Warren were expressly made exercisable by his agents, and by the agreement of 1960 he appointed Stokman his agent to exercise those rights and agreed that the slate should belong to Stokman. It seems that at the hearing before Myers J., counsel for the respondents, being invited to elect whether the statement of claim should be read as alleging an assignment to Stokman of the rights of entry or as an appointment of Stokman as Warren's agent, elected in favour of assignment. This arose out of a suggestion that Stokman was either an assignee from Warren or an agent for him, so that either he or Warren was the only proper plaintiff and the other should not have been joined. In truth, however, there was no election to be made. The assignment was equitable, so that Warren became a trustee for Stokman of such rights as the agreement of 1955 gave him at law, and as such was a necessary co-plaintiff with Stokman if Stokman be regarded as suing as equitable assignee: Performing Right Society Ltd. v. London Theatre of Varieties Ltd. (1924) AC 1 ; and there is nothing inconsistent with this in saying that as Warren's rights at law were exercisable by his agent and Stokman claims to exercise them as agent but nevertheless for his own benefit, Stokman is a proper plaintiff even in respect of what he claims to be entitled to do as agent. (at p77)

4. As regards so much of the mound as stands upon land under the provisions of the Real Property Act, I think the position is different, because the appellant Daphne Mills, having become the registered proprietor, is unaffected by any interest not on the register, even though she took with notice of it. If the case were one of fraud it would be otherwise ; but merely to take a transfer with notice or even actual knowledge that its registration will defeat an existing unregistered interest is not fraud: Real Property Act, 1900 (N.S.W.), s. 43 ; and see the cases collected by Gibbs J. in Friedman v. Barrett ; Ex p. Friedman (1962) Qd R 498, at p 512 . (at p78)

5. In the result I would vary the order appealed from by omitting the declaration as to the ownership of the slate, and by limiting the injunction so as to apply to so much only of the land as is not under the provisions of the Real Property Act. With a similar limitation I would add a declaration as asked in par. (B1) of the prayer of the statement of claim. Otherwise I would dismiss the appeal with costs. (at p78)

I have had the advantage of reading the judgment prepared by observations which I desire to make. The first is that on the assumption, which I accept, that the jury might reasonably find the cause of the plaintiff's injuries to be the presence on the floor of a wet substance of a greasy nature covering an area of eighteen inches by two or three inches, I do not think that proof of this fact was enough to enable the jury to infer negligence on the part of the defendant: proof was necessary of some additional circumstances tending, for example, to raise a probability of its having been there long enough to be seen if reasonable supervision were practised, or to show that so many people were likely to use the lavatory in the preceding hour that closer control was called for, or that the dropping of some such substance was common or inherently likely to occur. But very little might have been enough. For the case is one where the facts can hardly be within the knowledge of the plaintiff and, at all events so far as concerns the care and control of the premises and the precautions taken, must be peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant: cf. per Isaacs J., Morgan v. Babcock & Wilcox Ltd. (1929) 43 CLR 163, at p 178 and the cases there cited. But a plaintiff is not relieved of the necessity of offering some evidence of negligence by the fact that the material circumstances are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant; all that it means is that slight evidence may be enough unless explained away by the defendant and that the evidence should be weighted according to the power of the party to produce it, in accordance with the often repeated observation of Lord Mansfield in Blatch v. Archer [1774] EngR 2; (1774) 1 Cowp 63, at p 65 [1774] EngR 2; (98 ER 969, at p 970) : cf. Parker v. Paton (1941) 41 SR (NSW) 237; 58 WN 189 ; Ex parte Ferguson; Re Alexander (1944) 45 SR (NSW) 64; 62 WN 15 . (at p372)

2. But notwithstanding this principle I think that there is no evidence adduced by the plaintiff which will suffice to support the jury's verdict. (at p372)

3. The second matter which I desire to mention is the power of the Full Court to enter a verdict for the defendant despite the fact that the defendant did not request the judge at the trial to direct the jury to find a verdict in the defendant's favour. At common law the Court in banc could not enter a verdict unless power to do so was reserved at the trial. Such a reservation was based upon a convention, although a traditional convention: see Edmond Weil Inc. v. Russell [1936] HCA 26; (1936) 56 CLR 34, at p 46 and the authorities there cited. The statutory power conferred upon the Supreme Court by s. 7 of the Supreme Court Procedure Act 1900 takes the place of this practice. It is an independent power residing in the Full Court and is intended to avoid the necessity of a new trial existing at common law if no reservation had been made. To my mind O. XXII, r. 15 of the Rules of the Supreme Court does not assume to control the exercise of the power. Of course if the Full Court is of opinion that the plaintiff might have mended his hand at the trial, had the insufficiency of his evidence been pointed out on an application either for a verdict by direction or for a non-suit, doubtless that would affect the exercise of the power. But in a clear case where, on the state of evidence as the plaintiff necessarily left it, the defendant is entitled to a verdict, I do not see why a verdict in favour of a plaintiff who has not made out a cause of action should stand simply because at the trial the defendant went to the jury without asking for a direction. At worst it is a matter of costs. (at p372)

The declaration in this action purported to plead a cause of action under s. 64 (b) of the Workers' Compensation Act 1926-1954 (N.S.W.). The defendant demurred to the declaration. The Supreme Court of New South Wales allowed the demurrer. The judgment of the court denies the assuption upon which the declaration was founded, namely, that s. 64 applies to an injury caused by the negligence of the person described in the side note as the "stranger", if he is the husband of the "worker". The question decided by the court is of some general importance. The plaintiff applies for leave to appeal against the judgment of the Supreme Court. I would, however, refuse the application because, in my opinion, the judgment is clearly right. (at p618)

2. The allegations in the declaration were capable of constituting a good cause of action under s. 64 (b), if it were not the fact that the defendant and the "worker" were husband and wife. This fact was pleaded, no doubt, to invite a demurrer. It may be assumed that if the fact had not been alleged in the declaration it would have formed the substance of a plea. That the fact was alleged in the declaration was the basis of the demurrer. The plaintiff was not entitled to be indemnified under s. 64 (b) by the defendant unless he was liable to pay damages in respect of the "injury". Looking at s. 64, the defendant was so liable if the injury was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in him to pay damages in respect of it. The circumstances relied upon by the plaintiff were pleaded as circumstances amounting to negligence on the part of the defendant. Under the law of New South Wales, a wife cannot bring any action in tort against her husband except an action for the security and protection of her separate property: Married Women's Property Act 1901, s. 16. The "injury" pleaded in the declaration was within the scope of the Workers' Compensation Act - a personal injury. An action of negligence in which a wife claims damages for a personal injury is clearly not an action for the security and protection of her separate property. Therefore, the circumstances under which the declaration alleged that the "injury" was caused to the "worker" did not give rise to an action for damages. For that reason the circumstances did not create a legal liability in the defendant to pay damages. It follows an action by the plaintiff does not lie against the defendant under s. 64 (b). It was argued for the plaintiff that s. 64 postulates a legal liability to pay damages without any cause of action arising with it. I think that it was precisely because no cause of action arose that the defendant was never under a legal liability to pay damages in respect of the injury. This is demonstrated by sub-pars. (a) and (c). The former assumes that the worker can sue for damages for the injury and the latter assumes that he has obtained a judgment for damages. The result of these considerations is that the allegations in the declaration did not show that the defendant was liable, within the meaning of s. 64 (b) to pay damages in respect of the "injury". Indeed, they showed the contrary, because it appeared thereby that the defendant and the worker were husband and wife. As I have already said, I would refuse this application. (at p619)

I agree.

The articles of association provided for voting by proxy and entrusted the chairman with the duty of directing in what manner the poll should be taken. If he had made a full statement to the meeting explaining how proxy votes would be ascertained, this litigation might not have been persisted in, but I have no doubt that the reason why he thought it unnecessary to do so was because every one present knew that the poll was demanded so that the proxies should be used and because no reasonable man who read the face of the ballot paper and listened to what the chairman in fact said could fail to understand that, as it stood, the ballot paper was intended to operate as an indiscriminate exercise of the voter's entire voting strength, both as a shareholder and as a proxy. I feel sure that this was the conventional basis on which the poll proceeded, and I think that there is neither need nor room for the application of any presumption as to the significance of ambiguous acts done by a person bearing two capacities. I entirely agree with the reasons which Williams A.J. gave for dismissing the suit.

The facts upon which this difficult case really turns may be Pty. Ltd., having become solely entitled to the shares in D. Davis & Co. Pty. Ltd. proceeds to obtain transfers of certain of its valuable assets including fifty-seven shares in three other companies. There are no creditors who could complain of the transaction. It is therefore immaterial to the parties, except for purposes of the revenue laws of State or Commonwealth, for what consideration the assets are transferred to the holding company, that is Davis Investments Pty. Ltd., by the company whose issued share capital it holds, that is by D. Davis & Co. Pty. Ltd. By an agreement that is drawn up and executed by the respective companies the transaction is expressed as a sale and purchase of the shares in the other companies at prices which are in fact par, that is to say at 1 pound each. But the value of the fifty-seven shares is not 57 pounds: it is 54,382 pounds. By the transfer of the shares the holding company (Davis Investments Pty. Ltd.) gained no accession of wealth: for the value of the shares which it held in the other company (D. Davis & Co. Pty. Ltd.) dropped correspondingly; that is to say, their value decreased by 54,382 pounds less 57 pounds, or 54,325 pounds. What the transfer meant to the holding company was a change of the form of property containing this value. That is to say, by the transfers that company would become the immediate owner of the shares which theretofore were the property of the company whose share capital it held. The latter company (D. Davis & Co. Pty. Ltd.) of course parted with the ownership and so depleted the value of its assets. But as it did so to its only shareholder it thereby satisfied the potential demand of its shareholders upon its assets, demands that under the company law were exercisable or capable of effectuation by securing either the declaration of a dividend or dividends or a reduction of capital or a winding-up. There is nothing to suggest that the transfer of the shares at par worked an unauthorised reduction of capital of D. Davis & Co. Pty. Ltd.: so presumably the same result might have been obtained by a distribution in specie by way of dividend or by way of reduction of capital (see Ex parte Westburn Sugar Refineries Ltd. (1951) AC 625 ) or in a winding-up. (at p406)

2. The question in the case is what, in the foregoing circumstances, is the consideration for the transfers for the purpose of stamp duty under the Stamp Duties Act 1920-1949 (N.S.W.). The unencumbered value of the shares is fixed at 54,382 pounds. If the transfers when executed in pursuance of the agreement would be made upon a bona fide consideration in money or money's worth of less than the unencumbered value of the property transferred, then s. 66 (3A) operates to impose a stamp duty at ad valorem rates calculated as that sub-section prescribes. The excess of the unencumbered value, over the consideration is taxed at three and one-half per cent. If the consideration is the price of 57 pounds the result is that a duty becomes payable of 1,902 pounds 10s. 6d. If however the consideration, properly understood, is equal to the value of the shares transferred, namely 54,382 pounds, then the duty, so it appears, would work out at only 135 pounds 19s. 6d. For the rate of duty when the consideration is equal to the full value is comparatively low. (at p406)

3. The stamp duty to be ascertained is that which would be payable on the transfers, although it is the stamping of the agreement and not the transfers which is in question. For s. 41(1) provides that every agreement for the sale or conveyance of any property in New South Wales shall be charged with the same ad valorem duty to be paid by the purchaser or person to whom the property is agreed to be conveyed as if it were a conveyance of the property agreed to be sold or conveyed and shall be stamped accordingly. The words conveyance and convey cover transfer and that is true whether the property is real or personal: see ss. 65 and 3, "property". The result is that the stamp duty on the agreement is governed by the duty which would be payable upon the transfers, were they the instruments to be stamped. For that reason the inquiry must be whether the consideration for the transfers if and when executed would be what is nominated in the agreement as the price or would be the full value. (at p406)

4. Neither the nature nor the effect of the transaction is open to much question. The matter is really one of "characterisation". Must the price be characterised as the consideration or is it proper to characterise the further elements in the transaction which determine or govern its real effect the consideration? Assuming, as I think we should, that the transfer of the shares would not deprive the transferor company of assets representing paid-up share capital, the shares to be transferred must contain, in point of value, either accumulated trading profits or some accretion to capital over and above the equivalent of the paid-up share capital of the company. Such a "fund", whether real or notional, would be "distributable". In any case to sell and transfer these shares to the only shareholder of the company at a price which must amount to a nominal or book price effects a "distribution" of the trading or capital profit contained in or represented by the shares. It places in the shareholder's hands the trading or capital profit contained in or represented by the shares. It may be described in the terms employed in business or accountancy as a liberation or a distribution of or a transformation of title to the "fund" of profits. Doubtless it is not accomplished by a means provided by the company law, but if there is no interest involved but that of the shareholder, that is Davis Investments Pty. Ltd., no legal interest is invaded, and there is no one who is entitled to complain. (at p407)

5. In the present case the detailed facts suggest that the agreement for the transfers to the shareholder, Davis Investments Pty. Ltd., of the assets constituted by the shares, formed part of a wider plan for the re-allocation of interests. But into these facts I shall not enter because I think the case should be confined to the essential elements upon which the determination or ascertainment of the consideration must depend. The facts appear in the judgment of Kitto J. in whose very clear and precise analysis of the case I concur down almost to the final step. I see no reason to doubt that the substance of the matter was to "liberate" surplus assets of the company to its shareholder by transfers of the shares forming the assets at a nominal price. I treat it as clear enough that this was done because the sole shareholder (Davis Investments Pty. Ltd.) was entitled to cause it to be done. It appears to me to be clear enough too that the sole shareholder was able to cause it to be done in virtue of the rights attaching to the position occupied by a sole shareholder. Moreover the transfers, while changing the title to the assets consisting of the shares in other companies would not otherwise better or worsen the position of the sole shareholder, Davis Investments Pty. Ltd. Pro tanto the rights given by the shares thus held would be "effectuated", "realised", "fulfilled" "satisfied", or "exhausted". The choice of expression does not matter: what matters is that a fasciculus or congeries of rights in personam existed in the hands of Davis Investments Pty. Ltd. as sole shareholder in the exercise of which it proceeded to reduce into its ownership and possession the shares transferred, at the expense of a precisely corresponding loss of value in the shares embodying the rights so exercised. I do not recede at all from what I said in Archibald Howie Pty. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Stamp Duties (N.S.W.) [1948] HCA 28; (1948) 77 CLR 143 . But there we dealt with a transfer made wholly in pursuance of a resolution and order for the reduction of capital. The resolution and order formed a method of effectuating the rights of shareholders. Under the resolution and order it became the duty of the company to distribute to the shareholders in specie the assets consisting in shares in other companies. There was no consideration, no transaction, except this. But the shares were to be distributed "at the value thereof appearing in the books of the company" and those values were only seventy per cent of the true values. We decided for reasons to which I adhere that the "consideration" was the full value of the assets because no more was done than to satisfy the absolute right of the shareholders arising from the resolution and order. But in this case there is a final problem. It is true that in the present case the shareholder, Davis Investments Pty. Ltd., is able to obtain the contemplated transfers in virtue of the rights which shareholding gives. It is true that pro tanto those rights will be satisfied or exhausted by the transfers. But the transaction was thrown by the parties into the form of a sale at a price. In such a case how does the expression "conveyance (transfer) made upon a bona fide consideration in money or money's worth" apply? (at p408)

6. No doubt, when a transfer or other assurance of property is expressed to be made for a nominal consideration, for many purposes it is open to prove a further consideration not being inconsistent with the nominal consideration expressed therein. And this may be so although there is no mention of the real consideration. Cf. Clifford v. Turrell [1841] EngR 1212; (1841) 1 Y & CCC 138 (62 ER 826) ; affirmed. (1845) 14 LJ Ch 390 . (at p408)

7. But here, for their own purposes the parties have given the transaction the form of a sale at a price. Had it not been for the situation occupied by the two companies one to another it might not have been possible, or at all events lawful, to transfer at such prices. In a practical sense doubtless the transaction was "moved" by that circumstance. But within the meaning of the words in s. 66(3A) would the consideration moving the transfers - the consideration "upon" which the transfers are made - be anything but the price the parties chose to adopt? After all we are dealing with a transfer on sale. To go beyond the price may be to prefer realism to formal expression, but it means going to the circumstances warranting the parties in fixing the price they chose and that is not necessarily the same thing as consideration. It cannot be denied that it is an attractive view that the consideration in money or money's worth "upon" which the transfers would be made consists of all the essential elements involved in the change of rights effected by the transfers, involving as it does the effectuation of pre-existing rights. But, notwithstanding some hesitation, I have reached the conclusion that, in the circumstances of the present case, it is the price which must for the purposes of stamp duty be regarded as the consideration upon which the transfers would be made. I think that the transaction is not in itself a fulfilment or satisfaction of the rights of the shareholder as such. It is to be explained, indeed it is to be justified, by the existence of such rights or in other words by the legal situation which a sole shareholder occupies, but nevertheless the actual transaction is not one for which the law - the company law - provides for the effectuation of the rights and duties subsisting between shareholders and a company or for the effectuation of the property or personal rights of the shareholders in respect of the company. It is a transaction of purchase and sale. That is a form into which it was thrown because, doubtless, it was best calculated to achieve the ends of those in control. But considered as a transfer on sale it is a transfer for a price. The price is fixed by the parties for the sale, that is for the transfer. It is not supplied by the surrounding or accompanying circumstances, however essential the elements discoverable therein may be to the legal and economic efficacy of the transaction as a whole. In the end it is for that reason that the consideration must be confined to the price for the purpose of ascertaining the ad valorem stamp duty. The case is by no means an easy one but in my opinion the only consideration for the purpose of s. 66(3A) is the price of 57 pounds. (at p409)

8. It follows that I think the appeal should be dismissed. (at p409)

This appeal is from a judgment of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland dismissing an appeal from a decision of Andrews J. The matter involves a consideration of The Children's Services Act, 1965-1973 (Q.). It is an application by the appellants for custody of four children, of whom the appellants are the maternal grandparents. The appellants issued out of the Supreme Court of Queensland an originating summons seeking an order for the custody of the children, naming the children's mother (the appellants' daughter) as the respondent to the summons. Andrews J. made an interim order giving custody of the children to the appellants and adjourned the hearing of the summons. The present respondent Director applied by notice of motion to have the interim order set aside on the ground that Andrews J. had no jurisdiction to make the order, since, following an application under s. 47 of The Children's Services Act, 1965-1973 made by their mother, and a declaration by the Director under that section the children had been admitted to the care and protection of the Director and continued to be under his care and protection. Andrews J. held that in those circumstances he had no jurisdiction to make an order granting custody of the children to the appellants and on appeal to the Full Court his decision was affirmed. (at p349)

2. From the evidence, it appears that an application to have the children admitted to the care and protection of the Director was made by the mother under s. 47 of the Act and a declaration to that effect was made by the Director in April of 1970. The children had been placed in an orphanage, Nazareth House, Wynnum and the appellants had been granted access by the Director in March 1972. Then in July 1972 the Director found the appellants to be fit and proper persons to be foster parents of the children and until August 1973 the children lived with the appellants. In August 1973 the Director ordered that the children be permitted to spend their holidays with their mother. However, on 15th September the appellants took the children from their mother and brought them to their (the appellants') home. It would appear from the evidence that they did this because of their concern about the dangers to the health and morals of the children while living in their mother's house. On 24th September the Director had the children returned to their mother's home, claiming that since April 1970 the children had been under his care and protection and that the appellants' action had been contrary to the Act. Following these events, the appellants took out the summons applying for custody which is the subject of these proceedings. (at p349)

3. No allegation was made before us of any supervening unfitness of the appellants to have custody of the children. However, a strong case based on ample evidence that the mother was not a fit guardian was put before us in argument. (at p349)

4. It would seem from the evidence that the father of the children had deserted them and their mother permanently. (at p350)

5. The essential point which arises on appeal is the question of whether or not the provisions of The Children's Services Act, 1965-1973 take away jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Queensland to make orders for custody. The Supreme Court of Queensland was invested with such jurisdiction as part of its equitable jurisdiction by s. 22 of the Supreme Court Act, 1867 (Q.). Section 22 reads:

    "The said court shall have equitable jurisdiction within the
    said colony of Queensland and its dependencies and such
    power and authority to do exercise and perform all acts matters
    and things necessary for the due execution of such equitable
    jurisdiction as is possessed by the Lord High Chancellor
    or other equity judges of England in the exercise of similar
    jurisdiction within the realm of England and also to do all
    such other acts matters and things as can and may be done
    by the said Lord High Chancellor or other equity judges
    within the realm of England in the exercise of the common
    law jurisdiction to him belonging and to appoint guardians
    and committees of the persons and estates of infants and of
    natural-born fools lunatics and persons deprived of understanding
    and reason by the act of God and unable to govern
    themselves or their estates and for that purpose to inquire
    into hear and determine by inspection of the person the
    subject of such inquiry or by examination on oath or otherwise
    of the party in whose custody or charge such person may
    be or of any other person or persons or by such other ways
    and means by which the truth may be best discovered and
    to act in all cases whatsoever as fully and amply to all intents
    and purposes as the said Lord High Chancellor or other
    equity judges or the grantee from the Crown of the persons
    and estates of infants and lunatics natural-born fools and
    persons deprived of understanding as aforesaid may now lawfully
    do."

I would interpret the term "infant" in its legal sense for the purposes of this provision. Of this equitable jurisdiction Professor Holdsworth wrote in his History of English Law, vol. VI, p. 648:

    "The equitable control over infants, and the guardians of
    infants, arose in its modern form after the abolition of the
    military tenures, and the court of Wards and Liveries. The
    equitable jurisdiction was based, it is said, not on any inherent
    jurisdiction, but upon a special delegation by the crown of its
    prerogative right, as parens patriae, of looking after their
    interests. In 1696, in the case of Falkland v. Bertie (per Lord
    Somers L.C. [1696] EngR 25; (1696) 2 Vern 333, at p342 [1696] EngR 25; (23 ER 814, at p 818)
    ), it was said, 'In this court there were several
    things that belonged to the king as pater patriae, and fell
    under the care and direction of this court, as charities, infants,
    idiots, lunatics, etc. Afterwards such of them as were of profit
    and advantage to the king were removed to the Court of
    Wards by the statute; but upon the dissolution of that court,
    came back again to the Chancery.' This view has generally
    been accepted as the origin of this jurisdiction of the
    court...." (at p351)

6. Referring to the nature of this jurisdiction Kay L.J. said in Reg. v. Gyngall (1893) 2 QB 232, at p 248 , "it is essentially a parental jurisdiction, and that description of it involves that the main consideration to be acted upon in its exercise is the benefit or welfare of the child". (at p351)

7. The material part of the long title of The Children's Services Act, 1965-1973 is "An Act to Promote, Safeguard and Protect the well-being of the Children and Youth of the State through a Comprehensive and Co-ordinated Programme of Child and Family Welfare ..." Lord Moulton said in Vacher & Sons, Ltd. v. London Society of Compositors [1912] UKHL 3; (1913) AC 107, at p 128 : "The title of an Act is undoubtedly part of the Act itself, and it is legitimate to use it for the purpose of interpreting the Act as a whole and ascertaining its scope." I do not find in the title of The Children's Services Act, or in the body of the Act, any indication that the amendment or repeal of s. 22 of the Supreme Court Act, 1867 was within the contemplation of the legislature. Reading the whole of the Act I do not think that the jurisdiction and power conferred thereby on the Children's Court and the Director are intended to supplant entirely the Supreme Court in its equitable jurisdiction. I consider that the Act intends to supplement such jurisdiction in the way provided therein. (at p351)

8. As the equitable jurisdiction of the Supreme Court derives from a delegation of the prerogative of the Crown to the Court, that jurisdiction could only be taken away by a statute, if the statute does so expressly or by necessary implication. Indeed s. 13 of the Acts Interpretation Act, 1954-1970 (Q.) provides, "No Act hereafter passed shall be binding on the Crown or derogate from any prerogative right of the Crown unless express words are included therein for that purpose". In my judgment there is no such express intention in The Children's Services Act nor is any such intention to be implied of necessity from the whole scheme of the Act. (at p351)

9. Section 47 of The Children's Services Act, 1965-1973 (Q.) is in the following terms:

    "(1) An application may be made to the Director in or to
    the effect of the prescribed form to admit any child to his care
    and protection by any of the following persons:-
    (a) a parent of such child;
    (b) a guardian of such child;
    (c) a relative of such child;
    (d) a person of good repute.
    Upon receipt of such an application the Director shall
    make such inquiry and investigation as he considers necessary
    and shall hear all objections made to him concerning
    such application.
    (2) If the Director is satisfied that the child in respect of
    whom such an application is made is in need of care and
    protection and that such care and protection cannot be secured
    to such child by the giving of assistance under Part V
    of this Act he shall by writing under his hand declare such
    child to be admitted to his care and protection.
    Such declaration shall be sufficient authority for any person
    acting on behalf of the Director at any time while such
    declaration continues in force to take the child in care into
    his custody and to deliver such child in care to such place as
    the Director, from time to time directs, and for the person in
    charge of any such place to receive and keep the child in care
    until such child in care is otherwise lawfully dealt with.
    (3) No provision of this section shall be construed to
    render it mandatory upon the Director to take any child into
    his custody." (at p352)

10. It was suggested in argument that the case of Minister for the Interior v. Neyens [1964] HCA 71; (1964) 113 CLR 411 , a case which involved the Child Welfare Ordinance 1957 (A.C.T.), was a precedent on which to decide the question of jurisdiction in the present case adversely to the appellant. In my view, the relevant provisions of that Ordinance differ materially from s. 47 of the Queensland statute. Section 19 of the Ordinance by its terms states that "the Minister is the guardian of a child or young person who is a ward", "notwithstanding any other law of the Territory relating to the guardianship or custody of children or young persons". I find nothing in s. 47 of The Children's Services Act, 1965-1973 or in any part of the Act to indicate that its provisions are to take any precedence over existing laws relating to custody or guardianship or over the Supreme Court's equitable jurisdiction in particular. Indeed, s. 102 in Pt IX of the Act suggests the contrary. Section 102 reads:

    "No provision of this Part shall be construed to restrict or
    prejudice the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Queensland
    to appoint and remove guardians or otherwise in relation
    to infants."

As was said by Barwick C.J. in Minister for the Interior v. Neyens (1964) 113 CLR, at p 419 the jurisdiction said to be displaced "ought only to be treated as lost or withdrawn where this is done expressly or by necessary, indeed inescapable, implication". In my view the equitable jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Queensland in custody and guardianship matters affecting infants is preserved by The Children's Services Act to the extent that it is not necessarily inconsistent with the provisions of the Act. The Act does not presume to cover the whole field of the law relating to custody and guardianship of infants. (at p353)

11. I would allow the appeal and would order that the matter be remitted to the Supreme Court of Queensland for the determination of the appellants' application for custody of the children. (at p353)

The defendant, Nelson, was convicted upon two informations under the New South Wales Stock Act 1901, and these convictions were affirmed by this Court, which discharged rules nisi for statutory prohibition obtained by the defendant from the Supreme Court of New South Wales[13]. Of the four contentions upon which he relied three seem to have lacked substance, but in deciding the question raised by the fourth the Court was equally divided, judgment being given according to the opinion of the Chief Justice. This question was whether sec. 92 of the Commonwealth Constitution, in prescribing that trade, commerce and intercourse among the States shall be absolutely free, withdrew from the State Legislature power to enact the provisions creating the offences of which the defendant was convicted.

The defendant now applies under sec. 74 of the Constitution for certificates that the question is one which ought to be determined by His Majesty in Council. Sec. 74 forbids an appeal to the Sovereign in Council from a decision of the High Court upon any question as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States, or as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of any two or more States unless this Court shall certify that the question is one which ought to be determined by His Majesty in Council. It authorizes the Court so to certify if satisfied that for any special reason the certificate should be granted, and it provides that thereupon an appeal shall lie without further leave. The discretion to allow an appeal is given to this Court, and is denied to the Privy Council, only when a question has been decided of the class described; and in that case it is exercisable upon grounds which must include the precise nature, characteristics and incidents of such questions. For this reason, apart from others, it appears desirable in dealing with these applications for certificates to determine whether the substantial question which has been decided in the case answers the description contained in sec. 74.

For some time in this Court it was considered that sec. 92 of the Constitution bound States and Commonwealth alike. (See Fox v. Robbins[14]; R. v. Smithers; Ex parte Benson[15]; New South Wales v. Commonwealth[16]; Foggitt, Jones & Co. v. New South Wales[17]; Duncan v. Queensland[18].) But the view was afterwards taken that sec. 92 had no application to the Commonwealth. (See W. & A. McArthur Ltd. v. Queensland[19].) And in its application to the States it has been held to be "no more than an inhibition addressed to the Parliaments of the States preventing them from legislating so as to interfere with the freedom prescribed" (James v. South Australia[20]).

While the opinion prevailed that State and Commonwealth alike were forbidden by sec. 92 to hinder trade, commerce and intercourse among the States, it seems to have been taken for granted that an attack upon a statute for repugnancy to that section raised no question as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of a State or States. (See, e.g., per Isaacs J. (dissenting) in Duncan v. Queensland[21].)

This assumption appears plainly to have been correct. The expression "limits inter se" refers to some mutual relation between the powers belonging to the respective Governments of the Federal system. The required relation has been found in the effect which the process of defining the specific and paramount powers of the Commonwealth Parliament must have upon the ascertainment or determination of the amount of plenary power retained by the legislatures of the States. (See Jones v. Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration[22].) For in the process of defining the Commonwealth legislative power a line is ascertained. Upon one side of it is the undefined residue of absolute and uncontrolled power remaining to the States. Upon the other is the legislative power vested in the Commonwealth, made supreme by sec. 109. Upon that side of the line State legislative power, if any there be, is subordinate. It is a boundary at which the supreme power of the State begins, and that of the Commonwealth ends, a limit inter se of these plenary powers. The necessary relation has also been found in other forms of antinomy. When the independence of the executive power of the Commonwealth has been secured by assigning a limit to the legislative power of the States, this has been considered to be a decision upon a question as to the limits inter se of State and Commonwealth power. (See Baxter v. Commissioners of Taxation for New South Wales[23].) In the same way a claim that the State legislative power could not be used to regulate the conduct of an officer of the Commonwealth Executive was held to raise such a question. (See Pirrie v. Macfarlane[24].) Another example was probably afforded by the question whether the Commonwealth's legislative power over customs was so restricted by sec. 114 that the executive power of the State still included the right of free importation of goods. (See Attorney-General for New South Wales v. Collector of Customs for New South Wales[25].) There the claim made was, in effect, that a power of one Government, its executive power, obtained an independence and freedom from control at the expense of a different power of another Government, its legislative power, which was so restrained in order to bring about this result. So it has been considered that a question whether the judicial power belonging to a State Court could be diminished or affected by the exercise of the legislative power of the Commonwealth depended upon a mutual relation between these two constitutional powers which satisfied the terms of sec. 74. (See Commonwealth v. Kreglinger & Fernau Ltd., per Isaacs J.; secus per Higgins J.[26].)

The essential feature in all these instances is a mutuality in the relation of the constitutional powers: a reciprocal effect in the determination or ascertainment of the extent or the constitutional supremacy of either of them. This feature is quite absent when the question is about the meaning or application of a check or restraint to which all the governments are subject. Accordingly when it was believed that sec. 92 imposed a restriction upon the Commonwealth and the States alike, it was not doubted that a question under that section fell outside the provisions of sec. 74. But it is by no means easy to see why any different consequence should be produced by the contrary view, namely, the view that sec. 92 operates to impose a restraint upon the State power alone. Why should it follow from this interpretation of sec. 92 that any relation exists between the State power which it restricts and a Commonwealth power? And what mutuality can there be? If the Commonwealth is not bound by sec. 92 how can its powers be affected by the meaning or application given to the provisions of the section? Whether these provisions deny much or little power to the States must be immaterial as well for the purpose of defining the subject matter of Commonwealth power as for the purpose of determining its supremacy, of measuring its constitutional strength.

An answer to this conclusion was sought in the operation attributed to sec. 51 (I.) and sec. 92 when considered in combination. By sec. 51 (I.) the Parliament of the Commonwealth is authorized to legislate with respect to trade and commerce among the States. This power (subject to some qualifications not presently material) extends to every sort of legislation upon that subject matter, and so includes a power to make laws which diminish or altogether destroy the freedom of inter-State trade, the freedom interference with which is forbidden to the Parliaments of the States by sec. 92. Thus it is said that sec. 51 (I.) and sec. 92 together operate to give to the Parliament of the Commonwealth an exclusive power to make laws with respect to the freedom of trade and commerce among the States. There is nothing incorrect in this compendious method of expressing the truths that sec. 51 (I.) gives the Commonwealth a power to make laws with respect to a subject which includes the freedom of inter-State trade and that sec. 92 withdraws a power over such freedom from the States. But the phrase should not be allowed to obscure the fact that two very distinct propositions are contained in the assertion that the Commonwealth has an exclusive power over the freedom of inter-State trade, namely, first, that the Commonwealth has a power over it and, second, that the States have none; and it should be remembered that the first proposition depends upon sec. 51 (I.), and not at all upon sec. 92, and the second upon sec. 92, and not at all upon sec. 51 (I.).

Commencing, however, with the proposition that by means of sec. 92 and sec. 51 (I.) operating together, an exclusive power over the freedom of inter-State trade is given to the Commonwealth, the argument proceeds to the consequence that sec. 92 therefore fixes a dividing line, a common limit, between the exclusive power of the Commonwealth and the power of the State, and that for this reason its interpretation involves a question as to the limits inter se of the State and Commonwealth power.

But the simple fact is that sec. 92 gives no power. It is a restraint upon power. Whether an interpretation is placed upon it which deprives the States of much or little power in respect of trade and commerce, the commerce power of the Commonwealth remains precisely the same. It has the same ambit or extent and the same operation or effectiveness. The ambit of the commerce power is the same because sec. 51 (I.) defines it, not sec. 92. Indeed it is hard to see how a decision upon sec. 92 could even provide a judicial precedent which, if followed, would determine a question upon sec. 51 (I.). For the power which is conferred upon the Commonwealth Parliament by sec. 51 (I.) is not coextensive with that denied to the States by sec. 92. It is much greater: its limits reach far beyond the bounds of that commercial freedom upon which the States may not encroach. At any rate the decision actually given in this case by the majority of the Court has no bearing upon the meaning or application of sec. 51 (I.). The operation or effectiveness of the Commonwealth commerce power is the same because sec. 109 makes it plenary and supreme. Laws made as an exercise of Commonwealth power are paramount and absolute and prevail whether the States have or have not a power upon all or part only of the same subject.

When it is said that some portion of the Commonwealth legislative power is exclusive, the statement expresses and implies no more than that the States have no similar power. No difference is attributed to the operation or constitutional strength of the Commonwealth power. When, on the other hand, the same expression is used of a power of a State, it attributes to it an authority of a different nature and degree. For since the Commonwealth Legislature has no power on the same subject, the State power is not subordinate but is supreme. The absence of Commonwealth power means that no Commonwealth law can occupy any part of the field and so withdraw it from the State or hinder or defeat any exercise of State power. Such a power is not controlled, but plenary: not conditional, but absolute.

When, therefore, in Jones v. Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration[27] Earl Loreburn says "the High Court decided that the frontier of the Commonwealth power reaches in this case into the State and it therefore followed that the State has not exclusive, if any, power in this case," his meaning seems clearly enough to be that because the frontier or limits of the Commonwealth power had been advanced, such power, within the area of the advance, as the States would otherwise have possessed was not plenary and absolute, but was either annihilated or made subordinate to the paramount power of the Commonwealth. But if in this statement "Commonwealth" and "State" are interchanged it has no such significance. The proposition is not convertible. It cannot follow from the existence of a State power upon a given subject that such legislative power as otherwise the Commonwealth would have possessed is not plenary and absolute, but is either annihilated or made subordinate.

It may well be that where, as in the case of freedom of inter-State trade, the legislative power of the States is restricted and that of the Commonwealth is not, the Parliament of the latter may think fit to exercise or refrain from exercising its power on occasions or in ways other than it might, if it were open to the Parliaments of the States to deal with the subject. But this is not because the relevant powers are so distributed that they have limits inter se, a common boundary or some other mutual relation which causes the determination of the extent or supremacy of one of them to involve a complementary ascertainment of the existence content or efficacy of the other. It arises simply from the circumstance that the State has no power at all.

The absence of a mutual, or, indeed, any relation between such a restriction as that contained in sec. 92, and the delimitation of Commonwealth power is characteristic of most constitutional checks and restraints, because they are not designed to accomplish that distribution of powers among the respective governments of the Federal system which gives rise to the questions described by sec. 74, but to serve some other end as, for instance, to give a unity to Australia for purposes of commercial and civil intercourse and common citizenship. Such a check or restraint is to be found in sec. 117. In principle it would seem that unless a decision upon its meaning and application was a decision upon a question as to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of a State or States no decision upon the interpretation of sec. 92 could answer that description. But in Lee Fay v. Vincent[28] it was held by this Court that a controversy upon sec. 117 fell plainly outside the category.

These reasons lead to the conclusion that the question whether sec. 92 disabled the Parliament of New South Wales from enacting the laws under which the defendant was convicted is not in itself, and does not involve, a question as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States. It is clear that no question arose as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of any two or more States. It follows that the substantial question in this case does not fall within sec. 74. It is objected, however, that the Court ought not to give effect to such a conclusion, because of the manner in which the rules nisi came before it. It appears that upon the return of the rules nisi before the Supreme Court the parties concurred in the view that a question or questions arose as to the constitutional powers inter se of State and Commonwealth, so that by reason of sec. 38A of the Judiciary Act 1903-1927 the Supreme Court lost jurisdiction over the causes. The Supreme Court proceeded no further upon the rules nisi which came into this Court as under sec. 40A. Here no question, either of jurisdiction or of procedure, was raised. The matter did, of course, involve the interpretation of the Constitution and therefore in point of law the Court was given jurisdiction over it by sec. 30, whether it did or did not come within sec. 38A, which affects only the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and within sec. 40A, which relates only to the procedure of transfer. In this case the procedure laid down by sec. 40 or that laid down by sec. 18 might have been used for the purpose of bringing the rules nisi before this Court, and in strictness all that has occurred is that the parties have concurred in invoking the undeniable jurisdiction of the Court in a manner which may be inappropriate to their case. Such a course creates no res judicata between the parties and involves no issue-estoppel between them on the question whether a decision was given which answers the description transcribed from sec. 74 into secs. 38A and 40A of the Judiciary Act 1903-1927. If it were otherwise, there are many reasons for the view that the Court ought not to be affected by such considerations in dealing with an application under sec. 74.

Much of the difficulty of this case arises from the failure to keep the true problem steadily in view. The testatrix made her will upon the assumption that her property would be adequate to make effective all the dispositions which it contained including the ultimate residuary bequest. To search in her will for some intention as to which gifts should be preferred in the case of deficiency is futile. Her mind was not directed to that question. The law settles the order, in the absence of express intention, in which legacies and dispositions shall abate but the order depends upon the character or description of the legacy or disposition. The question in the present case is whether the provision in favour of the appellants amounts to a residuary bequest only or contains a particular bequest or pecuniary legacy. The judgment of Napier J. correctly defines the question and his Honor addressed his mind exclusively to it. The appeal, to my mind, was founded to a great extent upon arguments which departed from this question and set out upon a search for some indications of the testatrix's mind upon the order of priority which she desired or intended. I find myself in complete agreement with the judgment of Napier J. which deals very thoroughly with all the considerations which affect the true question and there is nothing which I could usefully add to his reasons. In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

The appellant appeals from a conviction under the Road and Railway Transport Acts 1930-1931 of South Australia. He was convicted of driving a motor lorry for the purpose of carrying goods for hire on the road between Gepps Cross and Tarlee, being a controlled route within the meaning of these Acts. He was not then the holder of a licence under the Acts or employed by the holder of a licence. The Transport Control Board constituted by the Acts had not issued any licences to operate vehicles on that route for the carriage of goods for hire. It appears that upon the occasion of the alleged offence the appellant was engaged in carrying goods from Broken Hill (New South Wales) to Adelaide (South Australia) in the course of his carrier's business which he conducted between those places. The ground of the appeal is that the State law could not forbid or control this act of inter-State transportation. The Road and Railway Transport Acts 1930-1931 are of the same order as the State Transport (Co-ordination) Act 1931 of New South Wales, the validity of which was upheld by this Court in R. v. Vizzard; Ex parte Hill[3]. Its precise plan of controlling transportation differs in a number of particulars. We listened to a valiant argument, commendable for its ingenuity, in which an effort was made to distinguish this case from that on the ground of these differences. In my opinion it is quite impossible to find any distinction which would warrant a different decision in the two cases. The decision in Vizzard's Case[4] is, I think, applicable and as there is no other substantial point in the case the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

The plaintiff had been an officer of the Post and Telegraph Department of Victoria which became transferred to the Commonwealth on 1st March 1901 under sec. 69 of the Commonwealth Constitution. Pursuant to sec. 84 of the Constitution, the plaintiff became subject to the control of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth and was retained in the service of the Commonwealth. He retired on 13th March 1932 at the age of 65 years. He was appointed to the Post and Telegraph Department of Victoria after 24th December 1881 and before 1st November 1883. On the 1st March 1901 there was no provision in the law of Victoria entitling officers appointed during that period to a pension on their retirement from the Public Service of Victoria. But in 1925 the State Parliament made provision for the payment of a pension to the officers of the Public Service who were appointed during the above-mentioned period, upon their retirement. This provision is now contained in sec. 58 of the Superannuation Act 1928.

For the plaintiff it is contended that sec. 84 of the Constitution assures to him a pension equivalent to that payable under sec. 58 of the Superannuation Act of Victoria, whereas the contention made for the Commonwealth is that sec. 84 gives him no title to a pension to which he had no existing or accruing right at the time he became an officer of the Commonwealth. In Lucy v. The Commonwealth[3], it was decided that the "existing and accruing rights" of any officer who was retained in the service of the Commonwealth were fixed when the department of which he was an officer was transferred to the Commonwealth. The general description "existing and accruing rights" is capable of including a right which is specially dealt with in sec. 84, namely, the right to retire and receive a pension. But the words which follow, namely, "and shall be entitled ..." are capable of conferring an additional right. I think that they have this effect. If by adding "and shall be entitled" sec. 84 intended merely to make it clear that the "existing and accruing rights" included whatever right the officer may have had at the time of transfer, to retire and receive a pension, words such as "including his right" would have been more appropriate to express that intention. Moreover that part of the section consisting of the words "and shall be entitled to retire from office at the time, and on the pension or retiring allowance, which would be permitted by the law of the State if his service with the Commonwealth were a continuation of his service with the State," deals with a pension on the footing that the officer's service in the State and his service in the Commonwealth should be regarded as a continuous period of service in the State. The pension thereby assured should therefore, I think, be that permitted by the law of the State in force at the date of retirement from the service of the Commonwealth.

Sec. 52 (II.) of the Constitution confers power on the Parliament of the Commonwealth to legislate with respect to matters relating to any department of the Public Service the control of which is by the Constitution transferred to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth. Sec. 84 is a restriction on that power. When a department became transferred to the Commonwealth the officers of the department became compulsorily transferred to the Commonwealth. It was, of course, just and reasonable to preserve their existing and accruing rights. But I think it was also just and reasonable, upon any proper consideration of the interests of these officers, not to defeat entirely any expectations they may have had of future benefits to be derived from their continuance in the Public Service of Victoria. If the contention of the Commonwealth be correct as to the construction of sec. 84, it is plain that no attempt was made to give any effect to this consideration. What benefits, if any, an officer might derive in the future were, of course, entirely unknown. But the question whether State law would permit him to retire at a pension and at what rate, if he continued in the service of the State, is one which would probably not have been omitted from consideration. Upon the language of sec. 84 the view is open that in addition to the accruing and existing rights of officers at the time of transfer, this question was taken into consideration. The language of the section does suggest that one of its objects is to secure that any officer therein mentioned should not suffer a loss of pension during his retirement on account of his compulsory transfer to the service of the Commonwealth. Sec. 84 does, in my opinion, assure to the plaintiff the benefit of a pension equivalent to that provided by the Superannuation Act of Victoria, which was passed after his compulsory transfer from the State to the Commonwealth. In this view it is unnecessary to consider whether the plaintiff's claim is supported by sec. 45 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act.

The demurrer, should, in my opinion, be overruled.

I agree with my brother Evatt that the appeal should be allowed.

The agreement which was entered into between the appellant and Ridley describes him as "the agent," but it does not expressly define the things which he was authorized to perform as the agent of the appellant. In my opinion it is not consistent with the terms of the agreement to say that the word "agent" in the agreement signifies only that Ridley is a person conducting the business of an insurance agent on his own account, and does not signify the existence of the relationship of principal and agent between the appellant and him. The evidence, moreover, does not warrant the inference that Ridley was in the position of a servant of the appellant. In saying this I do not imply, if such were his position, that upon the facts of this case, which have been reviewed by my brother Evatt and his examination of the nature of the prohibition contained in the first clause of the agreement, the appellant would be liable for the slanders which were uttered by Ridley.

It is clear that the appellant did not expressly authorize Ridley to slander the respondent or any other company or person. In fact, it made the prohibition which has been discussed in the judgment of my brother Evatt, a term of its agreement with Ridley. Despite the absence of any express authorization to do the act by which the respondent is aggrieved and the presence of the prohibition which includes that act within its scope, the appellant would be liable for the publication by Ridley of the slanders, which he has been proved to have published, if that act were done in exercising the authority with which Ridley was entrusted by the appellant. The fact that it was an abuse of that authority would not relieve the appellant of liability. What was that authority? It was not, of course, to do everything which the appellant itself could do or might have authorized to be done in its name. It was a limited authority. The effect of the agreement, in my opinion, was that Ridley became the agent of the appellant, by whom it would find persons who wanted to insure with it, and by whom the appellant would solicit persons to become willing to insure with it and would obtain proposals from such persons for acceptance or rejection by the appellant. It follows that Ridley would be acting within the scope of his authority, for example, when, in search of proponents for insurance, he spoke to people of the appellant Company, its business and its policies. He would be acting in the course of that authority if he made any false statement about those matters or said anything concerning them, which he was not expressly authorized to say or was forbidden to say. But I do not agree in the view that in defaming the respondent he was exercising the authority which he held as the representative of the appellant. To hold that a person in the position of Ridley was acting in the course of the authority with which he was entrusted by the appellant when he published any one of the slanders, which the learned Judge found, would involve the result that a person authorized by an insurance company to obtain business for it, has authority to persuade persons from whom he is seeking proposals for insurance to make them by criticizing the soundness of any other insurance company. In my view such an agent has authority to rely upon the merits of the company which he represents, but has no authority to criticize any other company for the purpose of obtaining business for his own company. There is nothing in the agreement which leads me to the conclusion that the criticism of any other company was a function pertaining to the canvasser Ridley, as the representative of the appellant. Speaking of the scope of the authority of the tax collector for whose slanders it was sought to make the corporation liable, Lord Shaw of Dunfermline said, in Glasgow Corporation v Lorimer[38]: "If, however, it were to be held that persons in the ordinary and comparatively humble position of this officer were within the scope of their employment in expressing opinions as to the conduct of those with whom they have dealings in the course of doing their work, the consequences might be of the most serious character, and the essential justice which underlies the maxim qui facit per alium facit per se would disappear."

The sense and reason of this statement, in my opinion, tends towards the rejection of the view that criticism of other companies was one of the instruments which the appellant had authorized Ridley to employ for the purpose of getting business for it. In uttering these slanders, I do not think he was merely abusing an authority with which he was invested. My conception of his authority leads me to the conclusion that he spoke as Ridley, not as Ridley the representative of the appellant. The facts of this case are quite different from the facts in Citizens' Life Assurance Co v Brown[39]. The publication of the slanders, though not capable of being referred, in my view, as a matter of law, to the exercise by Ridley of the authority with which he was entrusted, can be explained by the facts which have been so thoroughly reviewed by my brother Evatt. These facts reinforce the view that Ridley did not speak in his right as the representative of the appellant when he defamed the respondent.

I agree that the appeal should be allowed.

Since the passing of 5 & 6 Vict. c. 38, which first excluded from the jurisdiction of Courts of Quarter Sessions offences against the Sovereign's title, prerogative, person or government, or against either House of Parliament, it appears to have been taken for granted that coinage offences were triable at Quarter Sessions, subject to any particular exclusion depending upon the nature of the penalty imposed. It may be conceded that the nature of the power to coin money, as well as the history of coinage offences, gives ground for the contention that they are all offences against the prerogative in this sense that, although offences provided by statute, the statutory provisions creating them are designed to protect the prerogative. To coin money and use it as currency was an exercise of the prerogative power of the Crown. From early times the making of counterfeit money was considered treason at common law. Such offences were regarded, "not as mere frauds fraught with grave harm to the community, but also and chiefly as the invasion of a specially royal right which our Kings had jealously guarded, and any tampering with the King's image and superscription on seal or coin was assimilated to an attack upon his person" (Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law (1895), vol. 2, p. 503). Counterfeiting the King's money was expressly included in the statute of Edward III., 25 Edw. III., stat. 5, c. 2.

In many respects statute law now regulates the coinage. But the coining of money may still depend in England upon the prerogative as regulated by statute. (See Halsbury, 2nd ed., vol. 6, p. 549, note h.) The power of the Commonwealth, however, over coinage arises under sec. 51 (XII.) of the Constitution, which confers a legislative power. The Coinage Act 1909, passed in the exercise of that power, is the only source of authority for the Commonwealth to coin and issue money. Its authority in no way rests upon the King's prerogative. But under that Act (sec. 5) British coins are legal tender in Australia. For this reason it is suggested that money current in Australia does not depend exclusively on statutory authority. So much of it as is minted in England may rest ultimately upon an exercise of the prerogative. The offences created by Part IV. of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914-1932 include the counterfeiting and clipping of money minted in England. It is said, therefore, that these offences are designed to protect the prerogative on which the minting and issuing of such money finally depend. It may be matter for surprise that no one in England has ever raised the contention that coinage offences are outside the jurisdiction of Quarter Sessions because offences against the Sovereign's prerogative or government. But the fact is that such offences have not been considered of that nature. The expression "offences against the prerogative" is open to more than one meaning. It does not necessarily mean violations of penal laws which uphold the exercise of the prerogatives of the Crown or relate to things done under it. Offences existed at common law, simply because the prerogative itself required the subject to refrain from doing various acts. Probably the offences of that kind which survive are few in number. They include disobedience of proclamations commanding the observance of duties arising under the common law, and of other proclamations good at common law, perhaps offences which exist in virtue of proclamations validly made in time of war, and offences in relation to treasure trove (see Chitty, Prerogatives of the Crown (1820), and R. v. Thomas and Willett[3]). If the expression "offences against the prerogative" is confined to such offences, it clearly would not extend to coinage offences under statute. There is some difficulty in confining the expression to that meaning, because it occurs in conjunction with the words "against the Queen's ... person or government or against either House of Parliament." These words appear to describe the tendency of the offence and not the legal source from which it arises. But, hitherto, statutory offences have not been considered excluded as offences against the prerogative. The statutory description is nearly a hundred years old. When a long course of practice has been established under an old statute relating to judicial proceedings, and books of practice are uniform in stating it as law, it is very undesirable that Courts should take an opposite view. I find in Pritchard's Quarter Sessions (1875) that coinage offences are described under the title "Misdemeanours triable at Quarter Sessions." The earlier work on Quarter Sessions by Dickinson (1845) treats them as there triable. Many editions of Archbold's Criminal Pleading have indicated that, except when the punishment took them outside the jurisdiction, they were triable at Quarter Sessions. In Victoria, as I understand, it has been the constant practice, both before the Commonwealth Crimes Act and since, to try this class of crime at General Sessions. As the statute is susceptible of a construction which supports that practice, I think that construction should be adopted.

In my opinion the expression occurring in sec. 187 (IV.) of the Justices Act 1928 Vict. should be understood as referring to offences against the law which forms part of the law of the prerogative. I do not think that coinage offences are included in the words offences against the government.

For these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the criminal appeals remitted to the Full Court.

The discretion of the judge in cases of this kind is not trammelled by rules: it is unlimited. It is said, however, that in the exercise of this discretion there are certain matters which should be taken into consideration. These matters are set out in the speech of Viscount Simon L.C. in Blunt v. Blunt (1943) AC 517, at p 525 . I need not enumerate them. Those which apply most strongly to this case are (1) the position and interest of the children. They have hitherto been in the care of their mother or their maternal grandmother and the defendant has not taken any interest in them. As at present advised it will be, I think, in their interest that they should remain in the charge of their grandmother; (2) the impossibility of reconciliation; (3) the interest of the plaintiff who wishes to remarry and live respectably; (4) the interest of the party with whom the plaintiff has misconducted herself, who proposes to marry her; (5) the futility of insisting on the maintenance of a marriage which has hopelessly broken down; (6) that the plaintiff has admittedly for two years lived a chaste life. (at p539)

2. This conduct on the part of the plaintiff, the fact that the respondent went his own way and neglected his wife and children, and that she frankly disclosed her misconduct to her husband were circumstances to which his Honour did not attach sufficient weight. On the contrary, in his summing up of the matters which prevented him from exercising his discretion he referred to the plaintiff's flagrant adultery and to the probable encouragement to others to commit the offence in the hope of an exercise of discretion in their favour when their time came. The result of these proceedings will not impair or prejudice public morality or infringe public policy which "is a very unruly horse, and when once you get astride it you never know where it will carry you. It may lead you from the sound law. It is never argued at all but when other points fail" (Richardson v. Mellish [1824] EngR 715; (1824) 2 Bing 229, at p 252 [1824] EngR 715; (130 ER 294, at p 303) ). (at p539)

3. In the circumstances I consider that a decree nisi should be granted to the plaintiff. (at p539)

This is an application for an interlocutory injunction which by consent was treated as the hearing of the suit. As it is the hearing of the suit a declaration of right may be granted if the plaintiff makes out a case for that relief. The plaintiff is a seaman, at the moment without a ship, who complains of the Transport Workers (Seamen) Regulations made on 10th December 1935 under the Transport Workers Act 1928-1929. He attacks the validity of these regulations on the ground that they are obnoxious to the provisions of secs. 92 and 99 of the Constitution. The objection based on sec. 92 cannot succeed in this Court so long as the decision which we gave recently in James v. The Commonwealth[34] stands. In that case the Court decided to adhere to the decisions which construed sec. 92 as applying only to the States and as having no operation upon the Commonwealth. The decision is under appeal to the Privy Council but in the meantime we must follow it. This point therefore fails. It does not follow that if sec. 92 were held to bind the Commonwealth the regulations would be held to involve restraint upon the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse among the States. But that is a question I need not consider. The second ground for attacking the regulation lies in sec. 99 of the Constitution which provides that the Commonwealth shall not by any law or regulation of trade, commerce or revenue give preference to one State or any part thereof over any other State or any part thereof. The regulations provide a system for licensing seamen, but the system applies only at ports in the Commonwealth specified by notice in the Government Gazette by the Minister as ports in respect of which licensing officers shall be appointed. It appears that so far the Minister has appointed Sydney, Newcastle, Melbourne, Brisbane and Port Adelaide. It is said that the result is that a preference contrary to sec. 99 has been attempted. No one disputes that the Transport Workers Act and the regulations thereunder constitute a law or regulation of trade or commerce. But in what lies the preference of a State or part of a State over another State or part thereof? In Crowe v. The Commonwealth[35] we were called upon to consider sec. 99 in a somewhat different application. I said: "It is neither easy nor safe to attempt a definition of preference. Commercial preference may be accomplished by means which are indirect and ingenious, and it is much easier to say whether a particular thing is or is not a preference than to define the characteristics which a preference must possess"[36]. In that case I thought there was no preference because growers of dried fruit, who were the only persons concerned, received no "tangible advantage of a commercial character or any legal means of securing it"[37]. I still feel the difficulty of definition. But I think this case does not call upon us to attempt that task. I find it quite easy to say that there is no preference given to a State or a part of a State over another State or part of a State by these regulations or by the action of the Minister under them. There is no discrimination against individuals as denizens of States. The licensing systems may involve a disability in the case of seamen. But the imposition is conditioned upon what is considered the necessity of legislative or executive action in particular localities. No account of State boundaries is taken. No benefit or advantage is given to a State or part of a State to the detriment of another State or part of it. The question appears rather to be one of maintaining order and regularity and of acting only where those conditions do not exist or are imperilled. The notion of preference does not arise in such a connection. In my opinion the regulations are not invalid on this ground. As far as other grounds are concerned upon which they might conceivably be open to attack, the decision of this Court in Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co. Pty. Ltd. and Meakes v. Dignan[38] provides a complete answer.

In my opinion the suit should be dismissed with costs.

In view of the decision of a majority of the Court in Adcock v. the respondent is entitled to compensation under s. 9A (1) of the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act 1930-1967 (Cth). But I am not clear whether that result should be reached for the reasons that the soldier was living in at the camp and therefore not covered by s. 9A(1), or, that at the time he was injured he was not travelling "to his employment". However, I think that the decision in Adcock's Case (1) of Dixon C.J. on the interpretation of s. 9A(1) is right, also in the case of The Commonwealth v. Wright [1956] HCA 79; (1956) 96 CLR 536 . In the earlier case I wrote a judgment concurring with that of Dixon C.J. I regret that I am not free in the present case to apply the reasoning of the minority in these two cases. I think therefore that the appeal must be allowed. (at p306)

I think the facts in this case bring the payment in question within sec. 16, sub-sec. (d) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922-1929 and within the principle of the previous decisions of this Court of which the latest is Clarke v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation[1]. In my opinion the appeal should be allowed.

Subdivision C of Part III. of the Income Tax (Management) Act 1936 (N.S.W.) (secs. 31 to 51) contains provisions for the ascertainment of taxable income from a business carried on partly in and partly out of the State of New South Wales. Sec. 39 is as follows: "Where goods are sold in this State in the course of a business carried on out of this State but in Australia by a person not being the manufacturer of the goods, one-half of the profit arising from the sale shall be deemed to be income derived in this State."

The question is whether this section ought to be applied in the assessment of the profits derived by the appellant company from the sale of goods over the counter in some twenty-nine retail stores or draper's shops which it conducts in country towns in New South Wales.

The company is incorporated under the law of Victoria and is controlled and managed from Melbourne. Its business consists in establishing and conducting draper's shops or stores in country towns in Australia. It has fifty-nine such shops in Victoria, twenty-nine in New South Wales, three in South Australia, and three in Tasmania. The essence of the business seems to be uniformity and system in the conduct of the retail shops, organization in the supply and distribution amongst them of the stock-in-trade from a central source in Melbourne and rigid and close control, by the company's administrative officers there, of the management of the shops, so that a minimum of discretion is required by or allowed to the person in charge of each shop, always a woman manager. It is claimed for the company that its business is remarkable for its concentration of control and management; that it is not simply a chain-store business but an inseverable system controlled from the centre in Melbourne without any delegation of authority or discretion. In no shop can the manager buy anything: everything, stock and supplies, must come from the company's warehouse in Melbourne, to which the company's wholesale purchases are all delivered. The goods are distributed among the various shops by the company's motor transport vehicles. The shops are classified, and according to class the stock-in-trade in every one is uniform in quantity and description. The supplies are made so as to replace stock month by month. The costing and accounting is done in Melbourne. The staff are engaged and trained in Melbourne and sent to the shops. A shop manager has no general power of dismissal. Advertising is done from Melbourne. The goods are everywhere sold at the same standard price fixed from Melbourne. The shops, which, with a single exception, are owned by the company and not leased, are of a standard pattern and are designed in Melbourne. In the conduct of its business the company disregards State boundaries so far as it lawfully may.

On these facts the company maintains that, in its shops in New South Wales, it sells goods in the course of a business carried on in Victoria and that accordingly sec. 39 applies and its assessment for New-South-Wales income tax should be upon one-half only of the profit arising from such sales.

In my opinion this contention is erroneous. The section applies when a taxpayer's business is fixed and established outside New South Wales but by correspondence, by agents, by commercial travellers or by other descriptions of representatives, sales are made within New South Wales. It is not possible exhaustively to state the application of the provision, but these are typical examples. The section does not apply to a retailselling business conducted in shops or stores in the State simply because they are organized, controlled, and supplied with goods from outside the State, however systematized and disciplined the undertaking may be. In the towns in New South Wales the shops stand containing a stock of goods. At every shop the company carries on the business of a retail draper by selling the stock it contains to the customers who use the shop. Outwardly and ostensibly a shopkeeper's business is conducted in New South Wales. The arrangements for the supply of the goods, the locality of the source, the interconnection of the shops, and the administration of them all as part of a whole upon a common plan do not make the ostensible business any the less actual. The goods are sold in the course of a business, perhaps of twenty-nine businesses, carried on in New South Wales.

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

This appeal has caused me great difficulty. The point in the case should be held extinguished by accord and satisfaction. A question of accord and satisfaction is seldom easy but the difficulty which I have felt is not traceable to the unsatisfactory nature of the criteria the law provides. It arises rather from an inability clearly to perceive what was happening at the critical time between the parties themselves and between them and the auxiliaries upon whose counsel and assistance they seem to have depended. The story is a long and unedifying one of the financial relations between mistress and man upon which the oral evidence throws but a flickering light and the why and wherefore of which is left unanswered by the documents, though they are clear enough in themselves and certainly decisive of the passing of money. The mistress is the defendant and she appeals against a judgment pronounced against her in favour of the man for 17,157 pounds by Mansfield C.J. after a trial without a jury. The man, who is of course the plaintiff, sued for 24,235 pounds money lent, 7,217 pounds due upon a promissory note and 50 pounds money paid. The defendant's case was that there were no loans, no liability, and that in any case the plaintiff had sued once before and then had withdrawn his claim in circumstances affording her a defence of accord and satisfaction. She did not deny that for the most part she had had the money or that she had signed the promissory note but she denied that she was ever to pay or repay him anything. The plaintiff gave evidence but he was a man of seventy-three or thereabouts who four years earlier had been left by a cardiac illness with an enfeebled memory and his evidence could amount to very little. The defendant also gave evidence but she possessed no such advantage. No great credence was given to her evidence which was not regarded as reliable; moreover it clearly was defective on some matters, particularly as to the details of what happened over the withdrawal of the plaintiff's claim after he took the earlier proceedings. His claim for money lent was in respect of sums paid to the defendant between 3rd December 1951 and 20th August 1954, when it may be assumed that his illness terminated their association; but their relationship went back long before 1951. It was formed about 1941 at Wyandra a small town in Western Queensland where she was or had been housekeeper for McDonough, who apparently never lost touch with her and came to her help when in February 1956 the plaintiff issued his first writ against the defendant. In 1946 the plaintiff Phillott appears to have set up a flat for her in Brisbane. He paid the rent of the flat and gave her a weekly allowance. Other moneys he paid to her as well. For some reason at the beginning of 1950 or thereabouts she married. Her husband was a man named Ballantyne who lived and worked in Western Queensland. But within a year she resumed her relations with the plaintiff. A hotel was bought at Wyandra and for this he advanced 6,250 pounds to her which was secured by mortgage. From her husband a store was bought, in July 1954, and for this the plaintiff advanced 7,217 pounds for which she gave him her promissory note. For much of the time she lived in the flat in Brisbane but, if the evidence is to be believed, she and both her husband and the plaintiff Phillott lived and worked at the hotel at Wyandra. Of the many large sums of money, always in round figures paid to her, there is no very clear or intelligible explanation. In 1954 the association ceased and until the beginning of 1956 the plaintiff and defendant seem not to have been in communication. But on 14th February 1956 a writ was issued against the defendant on his behalf. The statement of claim upon the writ was for the same moneys and specifically pleaded the promissory note in terms which are sufficient unequivocally to indentify it. On 20th February 1956 an appearance in the action was entered on behalf of the defendant and on 21st February 1956 a notice of discontinuance was filed on behalf of the plaintiff endorsed with the consent of the defendant's solicitor. One might expect at this point a precise account of what happened: it is not however forthcoming. In his evidence the plaintiff gave a sketchy account of meeting the defendant accidentally in a city building at this time. She asked him "if he was going on with it". He answered "Yes" and she said she would pay him when she sold the hotel, to which he was agreeable. According to the defendant, she telephoned to the plaintiff after the service of the writ and said what a dreadful thing it was for him to do. He answered that he had to on account of tax and of his family: he would be up for gift duty and he was worried about tax. She arranged to meet him; they met in the city and talked and went from one place to another. At length he telephoned to his solicitor to withdraw the writ. The solicitor refused until there was an apology from a newspaper. This was in reference to a mistake that had been made in the reporting of the issue of the writ. She was described as plaintiff: this or possibly the correction when it was made, was apparently considered by the defendant as reflecting upon her. At all events she told him that she could sue him for libel. Later, almost certainly on or before 2nd March 1956, they waited for McDonough who came to the hotel after some time. Phillott the plaintiff had asked her if she would sign a document which would mean that she would have no action against him and he none against her: she said naturally she would. The story told by McDonough is that he was staying at the hotel in question, that he returned there late one day and found them waiting. Knowing of the writ he asked if they had composed their differences. The answer was that they had done so. Phillott asked him for a loan and McDonough in response said that they should give him something in writing to say that they had composed their differences before he would enter into any discussions. At this point it is necessary to refer to an officer of the Public Curator's office named Boyle who came now to play a part in the story. McDonough said that he had known Boyle and had seen him with Phillott. In evidence the latter said that he did not know Boyle, who however testified that in an hotel bar Phillott asked him if he could have a statement typed out for him: he produced the statement he desired to be typed. It was in handwriting. After some delay Boyle had it typed and handed the copies and the original back to Phillott. Boyle's evidence proceeded "I told him that I would not, myself, sign a thing like that, that if he did owe her any money why say he did, why say or why infer he owed her any money. I said, 'If she owes you any money and you are going to give it away, then somebody could be up for a considerable amount of gift duty.' I said, 'There is also this to consider, Frank, if you ever do make up your mind to have a go in the future to claim the money again you might find this thing in your road'". His evidence makes it plain that the document he had typed was that subsequently dated 6th March 1956. According to his evidence he did not know until later of that dated 2nd March 1956. The document of 6th March was signed by both the plaintiff and the defendant before a Justice of the Peace to whom Boyle took them on the later date. Somehow the document of 2nd March found its way into the defendant's possession. After it was signed it was given to McDonough. At this period McDonough was maintaining the defendant at the flat in Brisbane. In fact he did lend some money to the plaintiff Phillott. (at p387)

2. It is now convenient to set out the two documents. That dated 2nd March is as follows:-

    "2nd March 1956.

    That any action or proceeding in any Court heretofore
    commenced by the said Frank Pender Phillott against the
    said Roberta Ballantyne will be discontinued and that such
    action or proceeding shall not again be commenced by or on
    behalf of the said Frank Pender Phillott against the said
    Roberta Ballantyne and the said Frank Pender Phillott waives
    all any any rights or claims whatsoever which he has or may
    have had against the said Roberta Ballantyne by virtue of
    such action or proceeding or otherwise howsoever.

    That the said Roberta Ballantyne has no right or claim
    against the said Frank Pender Phillott in respect of or arising
    out of any such action or proceeding or otherwise howsoever.

    F. Phillott.
    Roberta Ballantyne.
    Witness
    E. J. McDonough." (at p387)


3. This document suggests the clauses drafted in a legal fashion but without operative words to form part of an agreement. Whether Boyle or someone else turned this into a statutory declaration cannot be discovered from the evidence. But the document of 6th March 1956 of which there are two copies as well as an unsigned copy takes that form. It is as follows: -

    "Queensland )

    We, Frank Pender Phillott of
    and Roberta Ballantyne of Victory Court
    Flats New Farm, Brisbane in the State of Queensland, do

    commenced by the said Frank Pender Phillott against the
    said Roberta Ballantyne shall be discontinued and that such
    action or proceeding shall not again be commenced by or
    on behalf of the said Frank Pender Phillott against the said
    Roberta Ballantyne

    2. That the said Frank Pender Phillott waives all and any
    rights or claims whatsoever which he has or may have had
    against the said Roberta Ballantyne by virtue of such action
    or proceeding or otherwise howsoever

    3. That the said Roberta Ballantyne has no right or claim

4. The foregoing narrative is not full: there are many points of evidence omitted: mostly questionable or dubious. But in substance the narrative sufficiently gives so much of the circumstances as the parties have chosen to unfold affecting the question upon which the appeal depends. That question is whether the plaintiff's prima facie cause of action is met by a plea in bar by way of accord and satisfaction or other discharge. For the appellant did not otherwise attack the findings of liability. It is to be remarked that the plea was not converted into one of accord and satisfaction until an amendment was sought for the purpose on the last day of the trial, which amendment was allowed when judgment was delivered. Until that time it seems to have been an equitable plea. The document relied upon was that of 6th March 1956. The amendment read, without the paragraph for which it is substituted, is hardly intelligible, but although the amended plea refers to no date it has been assumed that the document of 2nd March 1956 is not part of the accord and satisfaction pleaded. However that may be, if the documents, be they both the "agreement" of 2nd March 1956 and the declaration of 6th March 1956 or the latter only, are carefully read in light of the facts it appears to me to be quite clear that the plaintiff intended once for all to renounce for ever his rights against the defendant. It is true that the language speaks of his discontinuing the action as a step yet to be taken but that seems to be of little importance because he waives all or any rights or claims whatsoever which he has or may have had against the defendant. The words "by virtue of such action or proceeding or otherwise howsoever", might be felt difficult because the words "by virtue" strictly are inappropriate. Apparently they are used to convey the idea of the claims being covered by such action. But on the plaintiff's side there is, as I see it, a perfectly plain attempt to renounce all the claims against Roberta Ballantyne which he has made or could make. I see no difficulty in construing the word "waives" as expressing an abandonment or discharge of his rights and claims against the defendant: it is hard to give it any other sense. There appears to me to be only one difficulty and that is to find the consideration on her side which he accepts in discharge of the rights he waives. If he had overcome the prejudice ascribed to him by Boyle against solicitors, doubtless a seal would have been affixed and then no such point could be available to him. But as it is the question is whether he obtained or took any consideration. It is not a question whether an executory promise was proffered as, or formed, the consideration and whether that would suffice. See British Russian Gazette etc. Ltd. v. Associated Newspapers Ltd. (1933) 2 KB 616, at pp 643-645, 650-655 . It is a question whether the statement of the defendant Roberta Ballantyne that she had no right or claim against the plaintiff amounts to a present renunciation of anything of appreciable value or significance and was taken in exchange by the plaintiff. In the course of the cross-examination of the defendant, the emptiness of her claims was put to her. Her answers are what might be expected from a former mistress who though liberally supplied with money had been engaged in ventures with the man who kept her. She said she had told him that if they went into the details he owed her money too. There was a 1,000 pounds of which he took 500 pounds back and often, when at the hotel, he had different things. To a question whether she suggested there was a balance in her favour she said "Really if I had not met him I would be a lot better off today. I would not be sitting here." She would have been in a business. He had got quite a lot back going to the races and helping himself out of the safe (scil. at the hotel). There was no accurate account taken of the moneys. Counsel said "Let us make it clear" and thereby evoked the response "He did owe me money". "For?" "Everything." One may readily say "Of course she had no claim which a judge would enforce." But there remains the question whether the disclaimer or renunciation on her side of all rights against him had no value or import. His was by no means an unprecedented situation. He had mortified a woman with whom he had lived and had put her aside. Many men who have so behaved have failed to escape the natural consequences. Unless they "composed their differences" trouble might be expected. He had moreover been reproached for suing her by the man who now lent her his aid and he wished to borrow money from the latter. But no aid would be forthcoming until there were mutual guarantees of future amity. When McDonough said that he must have a document that they had composed their differences he wished to be sure that the plaintiff's claim was not revived and that on her part she made, and could make, none in the future. Odd as the documents are and slight as, in a legal point of view, might be the assessment given to the consideration she could exchange with his, yet it was something and I think in the circumstances it should be deemed enough. It is a result that accords with their mutual intentions and I think that it is authorized by this peculiar branch of law. (at p390)

5. One matter arose during the consideration of this case to which unfortunately I did not advert during the argument. The point is that if the promissory note was renounced in writing that might be enough to bar his suit upon it. See Foster v. Dawber [1851] EngR 671; (1851) 6 Ex 839, at p 851 [1851] EngR 671; (155 ER 785, at p 791) . It did not occur to me during the argument that the documents of 2nd March and of 6th March 1956 referred in terms to the action and that the writ identified the promissory note and thus between them you might spell out a written reference to the negotiable instrument in the documents which appear to me to renounce the plaintiff's causes of action. In the view I take of the whole case however this becomes immaterial. (at p391)

6. I would allow the appeal and enter judgment for the defendant. (at p391)

This is an order nisi for a writ of prohibition directed to a

2. The conciliation commissioner has before him two industrial disputes or alleged industrial disputes affecting the merchant service. One dispute arises from a log of claims served upon shipowners by the Merchant Service Guild of Australasia, which is a respondent to the order nisi. The other dispute arises from a log of claims served by the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, which also is a respondent to the order nisi. Each log contains claims for (1) pensions, (2) compensation for sickness and accident arising out of or in the course of the employment and (3) intervals off duty. (at p293)

3. The purpose of the writ of prohibition that is sought is to restrain the conciliation commissioner from proceeding with the hearing of these claims on the ground that to make an award in respect of them is beyond his authority. (at p293)

4. There is no substantial difference between the two logs in the manner in which the claims are respectively framed. It will be enough to deal with the material clauses as they stand in the log of the Merchant Service Guild.

1. Pensions. Clause 34 of that log is as follows: - "(a) An Agreement or an Award shall be made indeterminate so far as its duration is concerned, but subject to variation by mutual consent between the parties or by order of the Arbitration Court containing the undermentioned provisions for the payment of pensions.
(b) Notwithstanding that the employee may be retired by the employer the relationship of employer and employee shall continue while under the provisions set out hereunder, such employee is entitled to monetary allowance during the time he is not actually working.
(c) Upon attaining the age of 65 years or earlier, if, on the grounds of infirmity, he becomes unable to render the agreed service, the employee shall be entitled to a pension upon the undermentioned terms and qualifying period: (i) After fifteen years' service to an annual pension in one half of the annual salary he was earning over the last twelve months of his working period. (ii) After ten years' service to an annual pension in one quarter of his annual salary in the last year, and increasing by one-fifth of such salary for each year of service between ten and fifteen years.
(d) Such pension shall be adjusted quarterly in accordance with the retail price index numbers applied by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but so as to assure to the pensioner that the whole of his pension shall be adjusted in a manner that will assure to him the same purchasing power as the pension possessed when first granted to him.
(e) In the event of the employee predeceasing his wife, then the widow shall be paid one half of the pension to which the employee would have been entitled". (at p293)

5. In my opinion no award giving effect to this claim could be made consistently with s. 48 (1) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1951. That sub-section provides that an award, shall subject to the next succeeding section (which deals with setting aside or varying an award) continue in force for a period to be specified in the award, not exceeding five years from the date upon which the award comes into force. (at p294)

6. This provision does two things. It requires the conciliation commissioner or court to provide by the award for a definite period which must be named in the award and it limits that period, so to be named, to a maximum of five years. It is true that sub-s. (2) carries on the operation of the award to the making of the next award, subject to any order to the contrary and to the possibility of an order setting it aside. But that further continuance of the award is independent of the will of the commissioner or court (unless the will is expressed in an order otherwise or an order setting it aside). Otherwise the will of the conciliation commissioner or court is to be addressed to the specified period. (at p294)

7. Now it is quite clear that par. (a) of cl. 34 of the log is flatly opposed to the requirements of s. 48 (1). Paragraph (b) does not help. Indeed it appears to be nothing more than an attempt to give to a relationship which has in fact ceased to be that of employer and employee that character in law just because the definition of "industrial matters" makes that expression mean all matters pertaining to the relations of employers and employees. It is a device which can be of no service in bringing pensions within the authority of the commissioner or court if otherwise they are not within it. But par. (a) of cl. 34 has a purpose of a very different kind. It recognizes that a pension provision must go on indefinitely and therefore requires an award that is "indeterminate" in duration. An employee must be secured in his pension rights, however many years may elapse before he becomes sixty-five years of age. An employee who becomes sixty-five must be secured in the payment of his pension however many years it may be before his life drops. A pension scheme to operate only during the next five years would not make sense and it is not what cl. 34 contemplates. Hence par. (a). An inspection of the remaining paragraphs of cl. 34 is enough to show that this is so. It must not be forgotten that if at the end of five years a new award were made it could not cover former employees who had retired. A pension scheme therefore could not be carried on by award after award for successive periods of five years. The claim embodied in cl. 34 is for pensions during the remainder of the life of the employee who retires (or of his widow) and that means a claim that after the expiration of the next five years employers shall continue to perform obligations accruing thereafter over future intervals of time. That is a form of relief which by reason of s. 48 (1) an award cannot give. It is not possible to give effect to the whole or any part of the claim which cl. 34 makes and yet keep within the principle of s. 48 (1). I am therefore of opinion that the conciliation commissioner has no power to give any relief in respect of this claim.

2. Compensation for personal injury by illness or accident arising out of or in the course of the employment.

8. This matter is the subject of a claim expressed in sub-cl. (3) of cl. 28 of the log of the Merchant Service Guild. The sub-clause is as follows: "3. Compensation. - (a) If a personal injury by illness or accident arising out of or in the course of the employment be caused to an employee, the compensation payable by the employer shall be that provided for under the Commonwealth Seamen's Compensation Act, 1909, 1911, 1938, 1947 (as amended). Except that: (i) For the first three months of the duration of the incapacity in lieu of what would be payable under the said Act in respect to the said period the compensation shall be a sum equal to the pay which he would have earned had he been able to render the agreed service in the capacity obtaining at the time of the accident. (ii) Where death results from the injury there shall be paid to the personal representatives of the deceased a sum equal to four years' pay computed at the rate of the earnings of the employee at the time of the accident, with a right to such earnings being computed at the rate of the earnings over the last three months of such employment or lesser period if the employment in that capacity has not extended for three months". (at p295)

9. This sub-clause is followed by a fourth sub-clause which provides that the right to compensation shall not commence until the contract of employment has been determined and the employee is no longer entitled to wages. The sub-clause refers to a provision in the log setting out the conditions claimed concerning the termination of employment. (at p295)

10. The first question for consideration is whether the definition of "industrial matters" in s. 4 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1951 covers such a claim as that contained in sub-cll. 3 and 4 of the log. The statutory definition of "industrial dispute" is confined to disputes as to industrial matters. It is therefore necessary that the claim should relate to an industrial matter in the defined sense and if it does not the conciliation commissioner can make no award with respect to the claim. The definition of "industrial matters" begins with general words which make the expression mean all matters pertaining to the relations of employers and employees. These general words are followed by seventeen particular matters which the definition says the expression is to include "without limiting the generality of the foregoing". Of these seventeen particular matters one (par. (b)) is "the privileges, rights and duties of employers and employees", and another (par. (h)) is "the mode, terms and conditions of employment". (at p296)

11. I find it very difficult to see why the question whether the employer shall compensate the employee for injuries occasioned to him by reason of the employment does not pertain to the relations of the employer and employee and is not within the descriptions "rights and duties of employers and employees" and "terms and conditions of employment". (at p296)

12. If a risk of injury is involved in the performance of the work required by the employment the question whether the employer should compensate the employee for injury of that kind appears to me to be fairly within the foregoing parts of the definition: cf. The Builders' Labourers' Case, per Isaacs J. [1914] HCA 32; (1914) 18 CLR 224, at pp 249, 250 . No doubt the degree of connection between the employment and the cause of the injury postulated by any given claim on the subject made by a log requires consideration before the conclusion is reached that the claim does fall within the definition of "industrial matters". In the present case the use by the claim of the alternative "or" in the familiar phrase "arising out of or in the course of the employment" combined with the inclusion of illness may be thought possibly to go beyond what would give a sufficiently close connection. For the decided cases give the phrase a very wide application. "Illness arising in the course of the employment" might be interpreted as covering the onset of diseases which have no causal relation to the employment and if so a question might arise whether this "pertained" to the relation of employer and employee. But even if the expression were interpreted so that it went further than could be warranted under the definition of "industrial matters", the greater part of the ground covered by the claim nevertheless falls, as I think, within the definition and the possibility that an award adopting literally the phraseology of the claim might go too far is no sufficient reason for prohibiting the conciliation commissioner from proceeding with the claim. (at p296)

13. A further difficulty arises from the manner in which the claim is expressed. For it takes the Seamen's Compensation Act and, without explanation of how it is to be accomplished, demands that "the compensation payable by the employer shall be that provided for under" that Act. There is a misdescription in the claim in respect of the years given for the Act, which is now the Seamen's Compensation Act 1911-1949. But that does not matter. The definition of "seamen" contained in s. 3 (1) excludes expressly "a master, mate, engineer or radio officer of a ship". Hence the claim. If it is intended to apply the Seamen's Compensation Act directly to the excluded officers, this seems to be just what Parliament has decided against. But no one supposes that Parliament meant that employers should be under no liability to employees of the excluded category, suffering injury attributable to their employment. If the claim means no more than that the rates of compensation prescribed by the Act shall be applicable, probably that does not conflict with any intention to be ascribed to Parliament. But the conciliation commissioner cannot by his award extend to the officers in question the jurisdiction of the courts upon which the Seamen's Compensation Act confers the various authorities given by, for example, ss. 5 (3), 5C (3);- First Schedule, cll. (1) (a) (ii), (7A), (10), (17), (18); Second Schedule, cll. (2), (3), (7), (8) (e) and (12). See the Builders' Labourers' Case (1914) 18 CLR, particularly at p 252 . Further if the provisions of the Act were made applicable in full it would be found that in some respects the operation of the words with which cl. 3 (a) of the claim begins, viz.: - "if personal injury by illness or accident arising out of or in the course of the employment be caused to an employee", would be enlarged and in others qualified or restricted: see for instance ss. 3 (3), 5C and 5AA. Further there would be a possibility of the weekly payments and the provisions relating thereto being given a purported operation beyond the period specified in the award under s. 48 (2) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1951. (at p297)

14. It is evident that there are many difficulties in an attempt to incorporate the Act by reference in an award, in relation both to meaning and application and also validity and operation. But I think that the fair meaning of the claim in the log is that the organization demands that employees shall be compensated in respect of personal injury caused to them by illness or accident arising out of or in the course of the employment and that it demands that the compensation payable shall be that provided for under the Seamen's Compensation Act. The second demand I take as fixing the maximum limits of amounts payable. The first demand I take as seeking the imposition or concession of some liability to compensate such injury. (at p297)

15. The resulting dispute is wide enough to enable the conciliation commissioner, should he think fit to do so, to make an award which within the ambit of the dispute he may so frame that it does not encounter the difficulties I have mentioned or otherwise exceed the limits of his power. I do not think that ss. 127 and 132 of the Navigation Act 1912-1950 constitute an exhaustive statement of the liabilities which are to be imposed on shipowners in consequence of illness or accident in the case of masters, seamen or apprentices. These provisions may possibly occupy some part of the field exclusively but if so that field does not extend to compensation for such illness or accident at all events after the termination of the service.

16. I am of opinion that the conciliation commissioner ought not to be prohibited from proceeding with the hearing of the claims of the organizations with respect to injury by illness or accident arising out of or in the course of the employment.

    3. Intervals off duty. (at p298)

17. In my opinion the claims for these intervals fall within the province of the conciliation commissioner and are not claims for annual leave or other periodical leave within s. 13 (1) (c) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1951. I have had the advantage of reading the judgments prepared respectively by Williams J., Fullagar J. and Kitto J. which give reasons in which I fully concur for this conclusion. (at p298)

18. I think that the order nisi should be made absolute for a writ of prohibition limited to the claims made by cl. 34 (Pensions) of the log of the Merchant Service Guild of Australasia and by cl. 39 (Pensions) of the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers. (at p298)

I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. (at p217)

2. Section 230 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1944 says that any person or company whom the section makes answerable for an understatement of income done in breach of the section "shall be guilty of an offence" and that "a prosecution for an offence against this section" may be commenced within six years after the commission of the offence. Section 5 of the Crimes Act 1914-1946 applies to any person who aids and abets "the commission of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth." The section provides that an aider and abettor "shall be deemed to have committed that offence and shall be punishable accordingly." It is clearly in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the words of s. 230 and s. 5 to say that any person or company made answerable by the former section for the understatement of income in breach of it commits an offence against a law of the Commonwealth. But it is argued that the understatement cannot be aided and abetted in the proper sense of the words because the understatement does not amount to the commission of a crime. In order to accept that argument it would be necessary to ascribe to the words of s. 230 a meaning, other than their ordinary meaning, which the words could bear. The argument is based upon other sections of the Act providing procedure which is more appropriate to civil than to criminal matters, for the prosecution of "offences" against the Act. The authorities which have been cited in connection with this argument do not enable a clear conclusion to be reached that such procedural provisions alter the character which the words, "guilty of an offence," naturally ascribe to the conduct of understating income in breach of s. 230. I think that the better test is to accept the legislative definition of the conduct: I should hold accordingly that it is an offence and is criminal. It follows that the commission of this offence is within the scope and operation of s. 5. (at p218)

3. This section is expressed to apply not only to any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence against any law of the Commonwealth, but also to any person who "by act or omission is in any way directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or party to the commission" of any such offence. The charge against the appellant is that he "by act was directly knowingly concerned in" the understatement of income in breach of s. 230 on behalf of a company of which he was the public officer. Besides the argument that s. 5 did not apply to the understatement it was argued that the particular participation by the appellant alleged in the charge was not aiding and abetting and while an aider and abettor was punishable as a principal offender, a person connected with the offence in the manner charged in the complaint could not be so punishable. It is a matter for the legislature whether if a person is not an aider and abettor in the strict sense he should be subject to the same criminal liability as an aider and abettor. It follows that the complaint under s. 5 lies and was made within time. (at p218)

4. I agree however that it was not necessary to have recourse to s. 5 because upon the allegations in the complaint a charge would lie against the appellant under s. 230 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. (at p218)

In this appeal the appellant company challenges its conviction by a stipendiary magistrate for an offence committed at Wodonga in Victoria against s. 22 (1) of the Commercial Goods Vehicles Act 1958. Shortly the offence was that a semi-trailer belonging to the company operated on the highway at Wodonga without a licence or permit. By s. 3 of the Act, "operate" means "carry goods for hire" and "operation" has a corresponding interpretation. The vehicle was carrying goods in the course of the appellant's business. They were consigned at Melbourne, and the destination of the goods was Wodonga. The transit of the vehicle was from Melbourne through Albury in New South Wales to Wodonga. There was an interruption of the transit at the appellant's depot at Albury where goods for delivery there were unloaded. They had been placed on top of the Wodonga goods. The vehicle was refuelled and it was weighed at the depot after the Albury goods were discharged. The aggregate weight of the vehicle and the Wodonga goods was ascertained. The unladen weight of the vehicle was seven tons eight cwt. It appears in the certificate of registration of the vehicle. This is a New South Wales registration. The registration is endorsed "The abovementioned motor lorry is registered for use solely for purposes of interstate trade, commerce and intercourse". The weight of one consignment of the Wodonga goods was known before the weighing took place. It is probable on the evidence that the weight of the other consignment was also known. In any case there was a weighbridge at the appellant's depot in Melbourne which was available to the driver. The freight payable was calculated according to weight and was payable by the consignees. The invoices were made out at the office in the depot. However some check of the weights of each consignment of the Wodonga goods was made at the depot. The driver was given delivery dockets applying to each consignment. One of such dockets was to be signed by each consignee at Wodonga. The appellant contends that the conviction is contrary to s. 92 of the Constitution ; also to s. 4 of the abovementioned Act. This section precludes the application of Pt I, in which s. 22 appears, to commercial vehicles while used exclusively in the course of inter-State trade, commerce or intercourse. Neither s. 92 nor s. 4 embraces intra-State trade as such. The point raised under both sections is therefore the same. It is whether the vehicle was on the occasion in respect of which the conviction relates making an intra-State or an inter-State journey. (at p649)

2. I agree with the argument of the Solicitor-General that the journey as far as Albury served concurrently the two kinds of commerce - inter-State and intra-State ; that the inter-Stateness of the journey was complete at Albury and the succeeding part was intra-State : Golden v. Hotchkiss (1959) 101 CLR 568, at p 579 . (at p649)

3. Now s. 92 gives freedom to a carrier to make an incursion into another State even though it is an interruption of an intra-State journey between two points within a State. But as the borderhopping cases show the carrier does not as a matter of course enjoy the constitutional freedom which is accorded by s. 92. Neither would he necessarily exclude himself from the application of s. 22 of the present Act, pursuant to s. 4. I am of opinion that nothing was done at the appellant's depot at Albury to the vehicle or the Wodonga goods which gives ground for saying that the transport of such goods was an inter-State transaction. What was done is stated, in substance, above. These were only matters incidental or ancillary to the carriage of the Wodonga goods, which was a predominantly intra-State operation. They were not effective to give it the quality of inter-State commerce. (at p649)

4. When the vehicle recrossed the border, after leaving Albury for Wodonga, the inter-State elements arising merely from its journey in New South Wales were exhausted and the journeying in Victoria to Wodonga was essentially an intra-State affair. The information was laid in respect of it. (at p649)

5. The evidence, in my opinion, is not sufficient to show that at Albury there was an actual termination of the journey starting at Melbourne. Its expected terminus was always Wodonga. There was not, in fact, an inter-State journey ending at Albury, and a second journey of that kind starting there. The journeying of the vehicle between Melbourne and Albury had a dual purpose ; it served both intra-State and inter-State commerce. The incursion to Albury was a prolongation of the transit of the Wodonga goods. It did not give the carriage of those goods an inter-State dimension as far as s. 92 of the Constitution or s. 4 of the present Act is concerned. The question under consideration does not depend upon the ambit of the constitutional power in s. 51 (i.) of the Constitution. The incursion was merely territorial or spatial in character. There is no reason in law why the journey back to Wodonga should after the border is crossed enjoy the constitutional immunity or be excluded by s. 4 of the present Act from the application of s. 22. (at p650)

6. According to the evidence the appellant channelled through the depot at Albury all its traffic between places within Victoria and this was the reason why the vehicle called first at the depot. It is plain from admissions in cross-examination at the trial that this system of business is an attempt to shelter from s. 22 of the Act under s. 92 of the Constitution. It would be serious for the States and the Commonwealth if their respective legislative powers could be eroded by business practices designed to get under the protection of s. 92, which of course is a restriction not a grant, of legislative power. I think that the proper approach is to consider whether the "operation" which is in issue here was in its essential purposes an intra-State or an inter-State transaction. I refer of course to the transport of the Wodonga goods. I think that it was, as predicated by the Transport Regulation Board, predominantly and essentially an intra-State transaction. (at p650)

7. The circumstances of the case of Beach v. Wagner [1959] HCA 24; (1959) 101 CLR 604 , in my opinion, are markedly different from the circumstances of the present case. (at p650)

8. The appellant did not have a licence or permit for its vehicle which was involved in the charge on which it was convicted to "operate" as alleged by the informant. I am of the opinion the conviction now in question is right. The appeal should be dismissed. (at p650)

    This is an appeal by a taxpayer, pursuant to s. 260 of the Income 

Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1960 (Cth) from an order of a Judge of this Court, made on appeal from an assessment of the Commissioner, referred to the Court pursuant to s. 187 (b). The learned judge, Owen J., dismissed the appeal from the assessment. (at p438)

2. The facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the judgment of Menzies J. which I have had the advantage of reading and I shall not repeat them. Upon those facts, once it was held that the payment of the amount received by Breckler Pty. Ltd. from the taxpayer company was paid for boots and shoes as stock in trade, there could, I think, be no ground for excluding any part of it from the allowable deductions from assessable income. In my opinion, s. 260 of the Act can have no application to such a case as the present. Indeed, in spite of the views expressed by Owen J. and by Menzies J., I have great difficulty in seeing how it could apply to defeat or reduce any deduction otherwise truly allowable under s. 51. Moreover, I do not think that on the facts of this case there was any contract, agreement or arrangement to which the taxpayer was a party, falling within s. 260. But subject to the foregoing, I agree with the reasons given by Menzies J. for allowing the appeal. I think that the appeal should be allowed and the assessment set aside and remitted to the Commissioner for reassessment. (at p438)

I would allow this appeal and restore the decretal order of McLelland C.J. in Eq. (at p576) 
2. The words "Local Government Act, 1919, as amended" appearing in the restrictive covenant in question would be satisfied by applying them to the Local Government Act, 1919-1945 (N.S.W.). However it does not seem that it would make any difference to the result of the case to give the words "as amended" an ambulatory operation. (at p576) 
3. The full effect of the restrictive covenant is to be ascertained by reading it with s. 4 of the Local Government Act, 1919-1945, which contains the definition of the term "public reserve" mentioned in the covenant. The definition reads thus :
"'Public reserve' means public park and any land dedicated
or reserved from sale by the Crown for public health, recreation,
enjoyment or other public purpose of the like nature, but does
not include a common." (at p576)

4. It is clear that the covenant is not restricted only to prohibiting the use of the leased land for a purpose other than that of a public park. The covenant extends to prevent the land from being used for any purpose which does not pertain to "public health, recreation, enjoyment or other public purpose of the like nature". The concluding words of the definition "but does not include a common" are not relevant in this case. The covenant's phrase "for the purpose of a public reserve" should therefore be taken to attract the terms "for public health, recreation, enjoyment or other public purpose of the like nature". (at p576) 
5. Since the Association's use under the lease would clearly not be consistent with the concept of a public park, the question to be determined is whether such use would be for the purpose of "public health, recreation, enjoyment or other public purpose of the like nature". The word "public" obviously qualifies "recreation" and "enjoyment" also. (at p577) 
6. It is of course not incompatible with the notions of public recreation and public enjoyment that certain restrictions, both as to time and as to the activity pursued, should be placed on the use made by members of the public of a piece of land : Randwick Corporation v. Rutledge [1959] HCA 63; (1959) 102 CLR 54, at p 88; [1959] HCA 63; 5 LGRA 127, at p 172 (at p577) 
7. In my opinion, the exclusive possession, under a lease, of part of the land in question and the use of such area for the "proper activities of the Boy Scouts" exceeds the limitation of the word "public" in the enumeration of the purposes set forth in the definition of "Public reserve". The word implies use by the general public. It is not compatible with an exclusive right granted to a particular organization which could not be said to be substantially coincident with the general public. (at p577)

The appellants were trustees of a settlement and carried on a pastoral business. War-time profits tax was levied on the profits of the business for four successive accounting periods commencing with the period 1915-1916. The beneficiaries were sui juris and presently entitled in the relevant periods to receive the profits of the business, and they were assessed respectively for Commonwealth and State income tax in respect of the income which they received from the trustees. The question is whether the appellants are entitled to a deduction for the income tax paid by the beneficiaries in respect of that income under the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act 1917-1918. The relevant provisions of the Act are sub-sec. 4, par. a, and sub-sec. 5, par. a, of sec. 15. The latter provision is in pari materia with par. c of sub-sec. 4, and the case is governed by the reasoning in Kuhnel & Co. Ltd. v. Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (S.A.)[18] and Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (S.A.) v. Kuhnel & Co. Ltd.[19]. In applying the principle of this decision it is necessary to inquire whether the Commonwealth or State income tax laws which were in force at the relevant times made the trustees liable to pay income tax on the income received by them as trustees, The Commonwealth Acts in force were the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1916 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1918. As the beneficiaries were sui juris and presently entitled, the appellants were not liable to Commonwealth income tax on the profits for any of the accounting periods for which they have been assessed. The provisions of the relevant State Acts of New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia governing the liability of trustees for income tax on income received by them as trustees were only brought to our notice and there was no argument as to the effect of these provisions. Upon a perusal of the New South Wales Act, which is the New South Wales Income Tax (Management) Act 1912-1918, it would appear to impose a liability both on the trustee and on the beneficiaries, but the amounts of taxation payable by trustee and beneficiaries are not cumulative. I agree that it is correct to say that the tax paid under this Act in respect of the profits for each accounting period was taxation which "would have been payable" by the trustees, the present appellants, under the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act 1917-1918. The Queensland and the South Australian Acts are respectively the Income Tax Acts 1902 to 1918 and the Taxation Act 1915 (No. 1200). I agree that the taxation paid under these Acts is also within the provisions of sub-secs. 4 (a) and 5 (a) of sec. 15 of the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Acts 1917-1918.

The question should be answered: No, in the case of Commonwealth income tax, and Yes, in the case of income tax paid in New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland. In the latter case the deductions are to be arrived at by calculation of what might have been the amount of the trustees liability in each of these States, if the profits arising therein had been the only income derived therein as trustees.

Question answered that because the trustees distributed the income of the two years ending 30th June 1917 and because in the two years ending 30th June 1919 there were persons not under any disability who were presently entitled to the income thereof, there is no deduction from the profits of the accounting periods in respect of Commonwealth income tax paid in respect of the profits, but there are deductions in each of such four years in respect of State income tax for the States of New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland. Such deductions are to be ascertained by computing the tax for which the trustees might have been assessed and made liable in each of such States if the profits of the accounting periods referable to the States had been the only income derived by the trustees as such.

This appeal is from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Tasmania plaintiff do have the return of a certain motor truck on payment by the plaintiff to the defendant of 1,250 pounds or do recover against the defendant the sum of 1,450 pounds being the value of the vehicle 2,700 pounds less 1,250 pounds the amount due by the plaintiff to the defendant under a contract of sale of the said vehicle. (at p478)

2. The first alternative of the judgment is evidently based upon the hypothesis that property in the motor truck is vested in the plaintiff but he cannot recover possession except on payment of 1,250 pounds, which as will appear, is the residue of the price payable therefor by the plaintiff to the defendant. That cannot mean that a lien subsisted for unpaid purchase money for in that event the buyer would not be entitled to possession: Lord v. Price (1874) LR 9 Exch 54 . The second alternative is based simply on the view that property having passed to the buyer, as an alternative to delivery or redelivery, he can recover the value of the chattel less unpaid purchase money: cf. Chinery v. Viall [1860] EngR 451; (1860) 5 H & N 288 (157 ER 1192) . In this form of judgment the option to deliver the goods or pay their value lay with the defendant (Phillips v. Jones [1850] EngR 67; (1850) 15 QB 859 (117 ER 683) ) and this seems still to be so, unless a special order be made: cf. Bailey v. Gill (1919) 1 KB 41 . (at p479)

3. The question to which the judgment provides a solution, though a solution strongly challenged by the appellant, arises from a very commonplace transaction going amiss in an unexpected way at an unexpected point. The transaction was simply the purchase, on hire purchase terms provided by a motor finance or acceptance company, of a new motor vehicle with the trading-in of an old one to cover a substantial part of the price. What went wrong was the break-down of the motor vehicle traded-in after it had gone into the possession of the distributors or dealers and the new vehicle had gone into the possession of the purchaser. At the point of time when this happened the finance company had not formally accepted the hiring agreement. That company then renounced or refused the proposal and the distributors took back or repossessed the new vehicle. In this state of affairs Crawford J. has held that the property in the new vehicle passed, a cheque for the balance of purchase money having been offered to the distributors who refused it. On the basis that the property passed to the intending purchaser, who is the plaintiff in the action, his Honour gave judgment in the form already described against the distributors, who are the defendants. (at p479)

4. It is necessary to state the facts more in detail. The defendant appellant is City Motors (1933) Pty Ltd whose business in Hobart is to sell new motor vehicles. It is a subsidiary company or off-shoot of Perpetual Insurance and Securities Limited whose business in Hobart includes hire purchase finance of motor vehicles. That company is not a party to the proceedings. The plaintiff respondent is Southern Aerial Super Service Pty. Ltd. ("Super" is an abbreviation of "superphosphate", not a claim to the superiority of the service). It is a company carrying on operations at Campania, a farming district about thirty miles from Hobart, where it is represented by one Gangell, its managing director. He decided that the company should buy a new truck and trade in an old one. He communicated with the defendant company whose sales manager sent up two salesmen to inspect the truck to be traded-in. Next day they returned with a new Thames diesel truck which Gangell was agreeable that his company should buy. They placed the vehicle to be traded in under tests and, with one qualification, expressed themselves as satisfied; but they did not come to terms with Gangell who then went down to Hobart to see the sales manager. After some discussion in the course of which Gangell held out prospects of purchasing one or more vehicles later on, the sales manager agreed to sell the new truck for 2,700 pounds and to take the old truck as a trade-in at 1,450 pounds against that price. The qualification of the salesmen about the trade-in is not clearly explained. According to Gangell the sales manager said that (according to them) there was a little crack in the back of the cab and a noise in the cam shaft. At all events it was met by an agreement on the part of Gangell expressed in a letter addressed to the defendant company as follows - "Arising from an appraisal and general inspection (of the trade-in vehicle) I am prepared to authorize you to undertake such remedial action to rectify any fault that may be found with the motor overhead cam gear this (sic) reconditioning of the cab: this total expense is not to exceed the sum of 50 pounds. Costs incurred to be debited to my account." (at p480)

5. The sales manager asked whether Gangell wanted terms saying "We are allowing you 1,450 pounds on your vehicle leaving a balance of 1,250 pounds to be financed. How are we going to handle this?" According to him Gangell answered "Put it through the P.I.C. I have done business with them before." According to Gangell he answered that he could get terms down town. The sales manager then asked would Gangell let their firm have it; it would be some help and "they were carrying their own both combined". Crawford J. found that Gangell said that he could arrange terms for himself but was persuaded by the sales manager against doing that and agreed that an attempt should be made to obtain terms from Perpetual Insurance and Securities Limited. The sales manager then telephoned to Perpetual Insurance and Securities Limited, described the transaction and told Gangell it was "O.K.". Two instruments complying with the Hire Purchase Act, 1959 (Tas.) were filled in. The first consisted in the summary of financial obligations under the proposed hire purchase agreement and the second the agreement itself. The latter took the form of an offer by the plaintiff company to Perpetual Insurance and Securities Limited to hire the goods described therein, that is to say the Thames diesel truck. The form contained elaborate conditions but the two matters of importance are that it is expressed as an offer and that it states the "cash price", the insurance and the "terms charges". The like statement was contained in the "summary of financial obligations". That document stated that the cash price of the goods was 2,700 pounds, the terms charges were 196 pounds 12s. 0d., the insurance for one year 56 pounds and the total amount including the deposit of 1,450 pounds was 1,502 pounds 12s. (an error for 2,952 pounds 12s. 6d.) and the difference between the cash price of the goods and the total amount the buyer would have to pay was 252 pounds 12s. 6d. The hire purchase instalments were to be thirty in number and 50 pounds 1s. 9d. each in amount, payable monthly. The sales manager obtained for Gangell on the telephone at Campania the latter's driver so that he could inform him that the new Thames diesel truck could be put into use next day. Gangell signed the documents and returned to Campania. On the following day the two salesmen came and drove away the trade-in truck, leaving the plaintiff company in possession of the new truck which was already in use. Half-an-hour later they reappeared and said that they had had an accident. According to Gangell one of them said "I was a bit late. I was hooling the truck along and something started to rattle in it. Would you come to look at it?" Gangell went accordingly: he says that he found metal for about three chains down the road and that the engine was damaged. The question whether the fault lay with the salesmen or with the vehicle was not investigated at the trial, where it was not treated as relevant. The vehicle was towed to Hobart and placed in the defendant company's garage or yard. That was a Friday. On the telephone the sales manager told Gangell that Perpetual Insurance and Securities Limited had refused to accept the hire purchase agreement. Gangell said he would come to Hobart and pay cash for the new truck, meaning the balance of 1,250 pounds. He could not of course do that until the Monday, business houses being closed in the meantime. Two representatives had been sent to Campania by the defendant company to take possession of the new truck but the protest of Gangell led to their recall that night. However two men armed with a written authority from the defendant company came to Campania on Monday and by means of the authority persuaded the driver of the Thames diesel truck in the absence of Gangell to surrender it to them. The driver had no authority to do any such thing and it was known by the sales manager that Gangell violently objected to giving the truck up. It is to be presumed that the men sent to take it knew this too. They drove the truck back to Hobart where it has been retained by the defendant company. On the same day Gangell offered the sales manager to pay the sum of 1,250 pounds in cash and next day his solicitor sent his cheque for that amount with a letter demanding the return of the new vehicle. The cheque was returned and the request was refused. It is necessary only to add that reasons lying in Gangell's slowness to pay off instalments in prior dealings with Perpetual Insurance and Securities Limited were put forward as a justification for the refusal to accept the hire purchase agreement, but there can be little doubt that the operative reason was the break down of the trade-in vehicle. This was not contested by the appellants' counsel before this Court. Upon this state of fact Crawford J. adopted the view that a sufficient tender had been made to the defendant company of the sum of 1,250 pounds and that thereupon the property in the Thames diesel truck passed to the plaintiff company, which thus could sue in detinue. (at p482)

6. This view necessarily means that the proposed hire purchase agreement was simply a subordinate means for carrying out a purchase at 2,700 pounds of which 1,450 pounds had been discharged by delivery of the trade-in vehicle and 1,250 pounds remained to be paid either by means of a hire purchase agreement with a finance company or as a cash payment in money. (at p482)

7. The case is a difficult one but in the end the determination of the rights of parties must depend upon ascertaining their expressed and implied intentions as embodied in their bargain and of course applying the appropriate legal rules. It seems clear enough that, but for the desire that the 1,250 pounds forming the residue of the price should be paid by instalments secured by a hire purchase agreement, there would have been an executed contract by which the property in the trade-in vehicle passed to the defendant company and the property in the Thames diesel truck passed to the plaintiff company and the 1,250 pounds was paid, or else left outstanding as a debt for an executed consideration. But the desire to secure the amount of 1,250 pounds by a hire purchase agreement under which that sum was payable by instalments made it inevitable that the property in the Thames diesel truck should not pass to the plaintiff company. It must be vested in the hire purchase finance company and if, pending the acceptance of the hire purchase proposal whether by Perpetual Insurance and Securities Limited or by some other body prepared to finance the residue of the price, the property in the Thames diesel truck were to pass to the plaintiff company, the subsequent hire purchase agreement would be invalid as an unregistered bill of sale. We may therefore begin with the position that property in the new diesel truck was not to pass to the plaintiff company until it had been fully paid for. But clearly that company was to become the immediate bailee of the new truck and to put it forthwith into working use. Further the trade-in truck was to be handed over to the defendant company at once. What did all this mean? For the defendant appellant it is contended that the bargain was all subject to an implied condition that if Perpetual Insurance and Securities Limited refused the proposal for the hire purchase agreement the whole transaction lapsed or failed or was at once nullified. This does not seem to be the correct inference. Several considerations tell strongly against it. In the first place there were other finance companies and the manner in which Perpetual Insurance and Securities Limited was chosen does not warrant the assumption that the choice was an essential element in the transaction; it was a subsidiary matter. In the next place the trade-in truck was handed over at once to the defendant company, a car dealer and distributor, without any express reservation: as dealers they might deal with it as they chose and without delay. Then it must be remembered that both parties believed that Perpetual Insurance and Securities Limited had committed itself, although informally, to the transaction. Again the new Thames diesel truck was handed over to the plaintiff company to be put into immediate use as a necessary part of its plant and the sales manager of the defendant company was told of the need for going on without a gap. (at p483)

8. In all these circumstances the true inference appears to be that the manner in which the 1,250 pounds was found was a subsidiary and not an essential matter and that the new truck was received upon a bailment which could not be terminated without sufficient default on the part of the plaintiff respondent, while property in the trade-in truck passed at once unconditionally to the defendant company, on that company's men taking delivery of it and driving it away. There is no suggestion that any deception as to the state of the vehicle was practised upon the defendant company or its men or that there was any breach of condition as to its state of repair. The risk in respect of that vehicle seems to have passed to the defendant company before the vehicle sustained the damage or broke down. (at p483)

9. The possession of the plaintiff company of the Thames diesel truck as bailee was exclusive and in obtaining possession of it from the driver against the strongly expressed will of Gangell the defendant company committed a trespass to goods. That this may be so notwithstanding that the trespasser is the bailor appears to be shown by the cases discussed in his work Bailment in the Common Law (1952) by Sir George Paton under the head of "Theft by Owner from the Bailee": see s. 96 p. 444. The bailment seems clearly not to have been at will and the plaintiff company had made no default nor committed any act justifying its termination. There seems to be no reason why the bailee with an immediate right to possession should not maintain detinue against the bailor if the bailor is clearly entitled only "in reversion". To take the further step of saying that the tender of the 1,250 pounds on the Monday or Tuesday, assuming the tender by cheque to have been valid, resulted in the passing of the property, that is to say the "general property", in the Thames truck to the plaintiff company may be possible: in part it depends on the view that the agreement between the parties involved payment of the price in a lump sum on the failure of the attempt to obtain the acceptance of the hire purchase agreement proposed, in part on adopting the view of the law for which there appears to be good American authority (see Corpus Juris Secundum Sales vol. 78, s. 571, p. 288 and Williston on Sales Rev. ed. (1948) vol. 2 para. 331, p. 288) that tender of the price under an agreement to sell a specific chattel though unjustifiably repudiated by the seller may result in the property passing. But this point can be left undecided. (at p484)

10. It is proper to note that the defendant company had renounced the agreement and although the renunciation could not be effective, since it was not accepted, to terminate the contract, it meant that the owner no longer possessed an intention to transfer property and he did not actually receive the purchase money. Hunter v. Rice (1812) 15 East 100 (104 ER 782) , so far as has been discovered, is the only reported case where a rejected tender of the balance of the price might have been relied upon as a ground for holding that the property had passed. It was not an agreement to sell but an award given under a submission to arbitration. The award required that a tenant named Sharpe should give up a farm including a stock of hay straw and manure on payment of a certain sum. It was held that the award did not vest the property. The tender of the money which was rejected was not given the force of payment. Lord Ellenborough at one point in his judgment said "If indeed Sharpe had accepted the money tendered, that would have been a ratification of the award, and an assent on his part to the transfer of the property; but without that I cannot conceive that the property was transferred by the mere force of the award" (1812) 15 East, at p 102 (104 ER, at p 783) . Perhaps Lord Ellenborough would have distinguished an agreement to sell, although ex hypothesi it could not of its own force pass the property and although the purchaser had renounced performance. But it rather looks as if tender would not have been considered enough for the purpose. However what has been already said seems enough to establish the conclusion that had this action been framed in contract the plaintiff company must have recovered unliquidated damages. It is in fact framed in detinue and the question is whether the plaintiff company's title to possession as bailee is sufficient to support that form of action. (at p485)

11. It must be steadily borne in mind that the Thames diesel truck was in the possession of the plaintiff company as bailee and the vehicle was wrongfully taken out of that company's possession. The right asserted is simply to regain possession, not to establish a possession not before held. The title of the bailee persists: nothing has happened to destroy or impair it. It follows that he may sue in detinue. The owner or bailor who wrongfully took it from the bailee's possession is compellable to restore it. There is much to be said for the view that in the circumstances a judgment to be enforced by a writ of delivery would have been more appropriate, a judgment leaving the defendant company to its cross action for the balance of the price and if there be default in payment any remedies arising thereout. That of course assumes that enforcement of such a writ remains possible. But as there has not been a specific objection to the alternative form of judgment it is better to allow it to stand, notwithstanding the misgivings one may feel as to the amount of the damages named as an alternative to restoring the chattel. (at p485)

12. The appeal therefore should be dismissed. (at p485)

I agree. In my opinion the defendant was rightly convicted.

The application is for special leave to appeal. The circumstances, therefore, must be special to justify an order granting the application (Power v. The King[7]).

The substance of the applicant's contention is that mens rea is an ingredient of the offence with which the defendant was charged and the applicant therefore had a good common law defence, that is, the defence of a mistake of fact made in good faith, the mistake being that she believed the driver was the holder of a licence to drive the car. The Full Court thought that the evidence failed to support the defence.

But, in any case, I agree that the defence would not meet the charge. The defence is based on the contention, which, to state it more fully, is that the natural operation of the words of s. 30 is restricted by the maxim actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea. But is this maxim applicable to the construction of s. 30? The maxim is not of general application to modern statutes: See Cundy v. Le Cocq[8]; Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation[9].

It cannot be presumed that the legislature has not stated with precision what are the elements of the offence created by s. 30. The intention of the section (I refer to the material part) is to make it an offence for any person to permit another person who is in a forbidden class, that is, persons who do not hold licences to drive a car. It need not be doubted that the word "permit" is used in the ordinary meaning, but I cannot infer from the words of s. 30 that the offence, which is created, is to permit a person, whom the defendant knows is not the holder of a licence or has no reasonable ground for believing to be the holder of a licence, to drive a car. The case of McLeod v. Buchanan[10] is in pari materia and supports this construction of s. 30.

We have the advantage of a very full review of the provisions of the Act by the Chief Justice of South Australia. It is one of the plain objects of the Act to prevent any person but the holder of a licence from driving a motor car on a road. The prohibition is imposed in the interests of persons using the roads. The object of s. 30 is to prevent the driving of cars by any persons except licensed drivers. It is with that object that the section makes it an offence for the person who controls the car to drive it unless he is licensed, and also makes it an offence to permit any person who is in fact not licensed to drive the car. If the section also made it an offence for the owner of a car to permit an unskilled driver to drive his car it could hardly be contended that there was an implied qualification on the owner's liability that he would not be guilty of an offence if he believed that a person whom he permitted to drive was a skilled driver, but he was in fact quite unskilled. The only intention which is to be found in the section and which is the mental element requisite to a conviction is the intention to permit a person who is not in fact licensed to drive, to drive the car on a road.

This Court had a similar question of construction in the case of Francis v. Rowan[11]. In recent times the presumption of mens rea in statutory offences has suffered such an eclipse that a learned writer has warned legislators to be very circumspect to see that the necessary words are inserted in statutes creating offences if they wish to limit the numbers of potential law-breakers.

In my opinion the defendant was rightly convicted because upon the true construction of the section her guilt did not depend on the question whether she knew or believed on reasonable grounds that the driver was not the holder of a licence. She was guilty because it was proved that he was not the holder of a licence and that she did permit him to drive the car on a road.

The mens rea justifying the conviction consisted of the intent to do an act which is prohibited by s. 30, that is, to give permission to a person who was not the holder of a licence to drive the car on the road.

By this application a party to an appeal in this Court seeks an the costs of an appeal in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. We pronounced upon the merits of the appeal to this Court on 28th November 1955 [1955] HCA 63; (1955) 95 CLR 99 . It was an appeal from an order dismissing an appeal. The order was made by the Full Court of the Supreme Court and the appeal thereby dismissed was instituted by a plaintiff against a verdict which, at the end of his case, had been found for the defendant at the direction of the presiding judge. This Court was of opinion that the case ought not to have been withdrawn from the jury and accordingly pronounced judgment reversing the order of the Supreme Court. The minutes of the order to give effect to this Court's decision were expressed to allow the appeal with costs, to order that the order of the Full Court of the Supreme Court be discharged, and that in lieu thereof it be ordered that the appeal to that court be allowed with costs, the verdict for the defendant be set aside and there be a new trial of the action. As to costs, it was ordered that the costs of the former trial should abide the result. No order has yet been drawn up to give effect to the minutes of the order of this Court. It is therefore open to the Court to vary or add to it. The defendant in the action now applies to the Court to vary or add to the order pronounced by providing in some way that the defendant should have an indemnity certificate in respect of the costs of the appeal in the Supreme Court. The defendant in the action was the respondent to the appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court and was also the respondent to the appeal to this Court. The application in effect, if not in form, is that to the minutes of that part of the order pronounced which states what order shall be made in lieu of that discharged, we should now add a provision granting an indemnity certificate under s. 6 of the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (N.S.W.). (at p108)

2. That Act, the operation of which commenced on 11th November 1951, is entitled "An Act to make further and better provision in respect to the liability for costs of certain litigation; to establish a Suitors' Fund to meet such liability; and for purposes connected therewith". Section 3 establishes a Suitors' Fund and provides what moneys are to be paid into it. These moneys are described in s. 5 of the Act. The contributions consist of such percentage, not exceeding ten per cent, of the fees of court collected in State jurisdictions as may be fixed by the Governor in Council. The assets of the fund are vested in the Under Secretary of the Department of the Attorney-General and of Justice, who is for the purpose created a corporation sole. It is s. 6 that empowers a court of appeal of the State to grant an indemnity certificate and also describes what its effect shall be. Section 6 must be read with the definitions contained in s. 2. So read sub-s. (2) of s. 6 defines the extent of the indemnity which a certificate confers upon an unsuccessful respondent to an appeal in respect of his liability to pay the costs of his adversary and in respect of his own costs, an indemnity effected by recoupment from the Suitors' Fund. The power to grant an indemnity certificate is conferred by sub-s. (1) of s. 6. It is conferred only upon a "court determining an appeal". The sub-section provides that where an appeal against the decision of any court on a question of law succeeds, the court determining the appeal may grant to the respondent thereto or to any one or more of several respondents a certificate which is called an indemnity certificate. Sub-section (2) states the result. Where the respondent to an appeal obtains such an indemnity certificate the certificate entitles him to be paid from the fund (a) the whole of the appellant's costs of the appeal ordered to be paid by and actually paid by the respondent, and (b) the costs of the appeal incurred by the respondent. There are two limitations, fixed by provisos, upon the amount payable. One proviso says that what is payable under par. (b) shall not exceed what is payable under par. (a). The other enables the Governor to name a figure which shall be the limit of the amount payable. At present the figure named is 1,000 pounds. In sub-s. (2) the words "costs of the appeal" bear an artificial meaning as a result of the definition in s. 2, which extends the natural meaning. The expression is defined to include costs of any intermediate appeal and where the appeal is by way of motion for a new trial the costs of the first trial. Except for this the expression does not include the costs incurred in a court of first instance. An appeal is defined to include a motion for a new trial and any proceeding in the nature of an appeal. There are certain ancillary provisions made by the ensuing sub-sections of s. 6. Sub-section (3) deals with the possibility of more than one appeal. If what is called a court of lower appellate jurisdiction grants an indemnity certificate to a party before it and there is an appeal to a court of higher appellate jurisdiction which grants an indemnity certificate to the respondent to that appeal, the previous indemnity certificate is thereby vacated. Sub-section (4) has a very limited purpose, but in the second of the two paragraphs of which it consists, it manages to obscure the extent to which that purpose is to operate. The obscure paragraph, however, may be put aside as not presently material. It is enough to state the general purpose of the sub-section, which is to deprive an indemnity certificate of any force or effect during the time limited for appealing against the decision of the court which granted such a certificate and, if there be an appeal, during the pendency of the appeal. Sub-section (5) provides that the grant or refusal of an indemnity certificate shall be in the discretion of the court and no appeal shall lie against any such grant or refusal. Finally by sub-s. (7) it is provided that no indemnity certificate shall be granted in favour of the Crown or in favour of any company the paid up capital of which is of not less than 100,000 pounds. (at p110)

3. In Commissioner of Stamp Duties (N.S.W.) v. Owens (No. 2) [1953] HCA 62; (1953) 88 CLR 168 , we decided that the High Court of Australia was not a court within the operation of the Suitors' Fund Act. We held that the jurisdiction of this Court, which depends upon the Constitution of the Commonwealth and the laws validly made thereunder, could not in such a matter be affected by an exercise of the authority of the State legislature. Accordingly it was not a court to which s. 6 (1) of its own force could apply nor was there any reason to think that the term "court" in s. 6 (1) was intended to include the High Court of Australia (1953) 88 CLR, at p 169 . We also held that s. 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903-1950, supposing it to apply to the appellate jurisdiction of the Court, did not have the effect of arming the Court with the power created by the State legislation: ". . . it is no part of its purpose to pick up, so to speak, a provision of State law imposing on State courts such a function as that assigned to them by s. 6 (1) and convert it into a provision imposing a like function on federal courts" (1953) 88 CLR, at p 170 . We therefore held that this Court had no jurisdiction to grant a certificate which would have the effect of enabling the respondent to an appeal to this Court to obtain from the Suitors' Fund the costs he had incurred in this Court or to obtain reimbursement of the costs incurred by his opponent in this Court which he had been ordered to pay. That decision, as will be seen, was concerned with a claim to indemnity out of the fund in respect of costs incurred in this Court, not in respect of costs incurred in the court from which the appeal came to this Court. The claimant failed because the Act possessed no operation in relation to costs incurred in this Court; it could possess no such operation of its own direct force and it was not given such an operation by s. 79 of the Judiciary Act. (at p110)

4. The present case concerns not the costs incurred in this Court but the costs incurred in the Supreme Court. It concerns not the power of this Court derived directly or indirectly from the State Act to pronounce initially on the question whether a certificate should be granted. What it concerns is the extent of the power of this Court under its appellate jurisdiction, exercisable in respect of judgments of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, a power which enables this Court to substitute for the order of the Supreme Court the order which in the opinion of this Court ought to have been made. (at p111)

5. In the present case the decision of this Court was that the Supreme Court's decision upon the merits was erroneous and that its order must be discharged. That order dismissed an appeal. Section 6 does not authorize the Supreme Court when it dismisses an appeal to give an indemnity certificate. The Supreme Court therefore could not be asked for such a certificate. Our decision was, however, that the Supreme Court ought to have allowed the appeal. Had the Supreme Court allowed the appeal the power of that court would have arisen to grant an indemnity certificate to the unsuccessful respondent to that appeal. The question is therefore whether, when we undertake in the exercise of our appellate power to substitute for the order made by the Supreme Court the order which in our view that court ought to have made, our power extends to the grant of the indemnity certificate which would, or might have been, consequential upon an order allowing the appeal, had the Supreme Court made it. (at p111)

6. The appellate jurisdiction of this Court involves a full appeal. On the one hand in its exercise this Court may give such judgment as ought to have been given by the court appealed from. On the other hand this Court cannot, in substitution for the order of the court appealed from, make an order which was not competent to that court. In the language of s. 37 of the Judiciary Act 1903-1955, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction the Court may confirm, reverse or modify the judgment appealed from and may give such judgment as ought to have been given in the first instance. (at p111)

7. The question which this case raises is whether the function which s. 6 of the Suitors' Fund Act confides to the Supreme Court lies outside the ambit of this power of the High Court. Two grounds have been suggested for so regarding it. One ground is that an indemnity certificate does not concern the controversy between the parties but relates only to the rights of the unsuccessful party to recoupment from a governmental fund. The other is that the grant of an indemnity certificate is not a function of a judicial character. This second reason severs without justification the duty of the court to exercise its discretion under the Suitors' Fund Act from the order it makes inter partes as to costs and from the view of the court of the nature and circumstances of the appeal. The function under the Suitors' Fund Act is new but it is consequential upon and intimately bound up with the disposition of the appeal. The first of the two reasons seems to imply an undue limitation of the appellate power. The essence of s. 6 of the Suitors' Fund Act is to give the State court determining the appeal an ancillary or incidental authority. It supposes that the court has determined the appeal by allowing it in whole or in part. Paragraph (a) of sub-s. (2) of s. 6 contemplates an order by the court awarding the costs of the appeal against the unsuccessful respondent. It then proceeds on that footing to authorise the court determining the appeal to give a certificate which indemnifies the unsuccessful party from the consequences of that order. It is a State law which closely affects the consequences of an appeal and of the order which the appellate court may make. Let it be supposed that, having allowed an appeal, the Supreme Court made such an order. If the unsuccessful respondent appealed to this Court and this Court set aside the order of the Supreme Court allowing the appeal, the very ground upon which s. 6 enabled the Supreme Court to grant an indemnity certificate would have been destroyed. Ought not the order of this Court then to proceed, as part of its order disposing of the appeal, to set aside the indemnity certificate? Correspondingly when the Supreme Court, by a decision which in the view of this Court is erroneous has dismissed an appeal, the error ex hypothesi has prevented the occasion for granting an indemnity certificate arising. Would the jurisdiction of this Court to do according to State law what the Supreme Court ought to have done in disposing of the appeal be completely exercised unless it took the further step of saying whether the Supreme Court ought or ought not, in allowing the appeal, to have granted an indemnity certificate? It is not a question of this Court exercising an independent power. It is entirely a question of this Court superseding the decision of the Supreme Court and replacing it with that decision which, according to State law, ought to have been given in disposing of the proceeding before the Supreme Court. The power given by s. 6 is new and in many ways anomalous but it appears to be a power given to State appellate courts because State law regards it as appropriate for the purpose of doing complete justice in the litigation. True it is that it does not operate inter partes and that it relates to a consequence upon one party of a decision given inter partes. But nevertheless in my opinion it would be too narrow a view of the appellate power to regard it as not reaching far enough to cover the entire decision which the Supreme Court ought to have given in disposing of the appeal. (at p113)

8. For these reasons I am of opinion that it is competent to this Court to add to the order pronounced upon 28th November 1955 upon the appeal a further provision as part of the order substituted for the order of the Supreme Court so that the substituted order would include the grant of an indemnity certificate in respect of the costs of the appeal in the Supreme Court. (at p113)

9. The question remains whether in substance it is a proper case for the grant of such an indemnity certificate. Sub-section (1) of s. 6 grants a power which, as s. 6 (5) shows, is to be exercised as a matter of discretion. It provides that the court determining the appeal may grant to the respondent thereto an indemnity certificate. The power arises only when an appeal against the decision of a court on a question of law succeeds. Very little light is to be obtained from the long title or the provisions of the Act as to the considerations which should govern the exercise of the discretion to grant a certificate. But since it does not arise except in the case of a successful appeal against a decision upon a question of law, it would seem that the purpose of the legislature was to relieve litigants of the burden of costs that might be imposed upon them by reason of erroneous decisions upon questions of law. In the present case no question was involved as to any principle of law or any application of principle or as to the meaning or effect of any statutory provision. It is true that in the legal dichotomy between questions of fact and questions of law we place under the latter head a question whether there is sufficient evidence to submit to a jury in support of a cause of action. That is because it is a question for the court to decide and not for a tribunal of fact. In the present case no considerations of law affected the matter at all. It was simply a question whether the evidence adduced was enough to enable the jury to draw an inference of fact. Further, the defendant is a limited company apparently not without assets. All that we know concerning the finances of the defendant company is that its paid up capital is 84,000 pounds. At the trial the defendant company's counsel advisedly sought to withdraw the case from the decision of the jury. To take such a course involved an obvious risk. I cannot see why, because in the result it turned out badly, the defendant should have a claim upon the discretion of the Court to certify for the recoupment of the costs out of a public fund. Indeed I can see no sound reason why the defendant company should be indemnified for costs out of the Suitors' Fund. In my opinion the discretion given by s. 6 should in this case be exercised by refusing a certificate. I would on that ground refuse the application of the defendant respondent. (at p114)

McTIERNAN J. This is an application on behalf of the respondent in this appeal for an "indemnity certificate" under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (N.S.W.). The High Court is not a court which is vested by that Act with the discretion of granting or refusing such a certificate. But this application is made in this appeal. It is founded upon the assumption that the power of the High Court under s. 37 of the Judiciary Act 1903-1955 enables the Court to operate s. 6 (1) of the Suitors' Fund Act 1951. This provision, s. 6 (1), applies where an appeal against the decision of any court on a question of law succeeds. It was not within the discretion of the trial judge to give any indemnity certificate. The right to such a certificate was not involved in the action between these parties. It cannot be said that an order for a certificate of indemnity ought to have been made "in the first instance", if that means in this case the trial of the action. Section 6 (1) of the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 provides that where an appeal to which it applies succeeds, the court determining the appeal may grant to the respondent an indemnity certificate. A motion for a new trial is an appeal for the purposes of this provision: Suitors' Fund Act, s. 2. It is provided by s. 6 (5) that the grant or refusal of an indemnity certificate shall be in the discretion of the court and no appeal shall lie against any such grant or refusal. The motion for a new trial was the first stage in the present case at which an indemnity certificate could be granted. If the motion had succeeded it would have been within the discretion of the Full Court to grant or refuse a certificate. The certificate would have entitled the respondent to be paid from the Suitors' Fund which is established under the Act, the whole of the appellant's costs of the motion which the court ordered him to bear and which he actually paid, besides his own costs of the motion for a new trial: s. 6 (2). The costs of the first trial could have been also covered by the certificate: s. 2 (b). As regards the grant of a certificate the Full Court of New South Wales was the court of first instance. It was too the first court that could have granted the motion for a new trial. According to the judgment of the High Court the Full Court ought to have ordered that the motion be allowed. If the Full Court of New South Wales had made this order it is to be presumed that it would have granted to the respondent an indemnity certificate under s. 6 (1). The ground upon which the respondent applies for an indemnity certificate is that it ought to have been granted in the first instance by the Full Court of New South Wales as the court determining the "appeal", that is the motion for a new trial. The certificate for which the respondent applies to the High Court would be that which would have been within the discretion of the Full Court to grant to it. The certificate would cover the appellant's costs in the Supreme Court, which the High Court ordered the respondent to pay, but not any costs incurred by it in the appeal to the High Court. The appeal against the judgment of the Full Court brought up to this Court for consideration the motion for a new trial and under the appellant power this Court could make any order that the Full Court ought to have made in that motion. Section 6 (1) of the Suitors' Fund Act does not make the function of granting an indemnity certificate one to be performed by the appellate court in the course of determining the appeal. The words "the court determining the appeal" are a description of the court in which the discretion to grant or refuse an indemnity certificate is vested. The condition precedent to the grant of such a certificate is that the appeal has succeeded. Section 6 (2) contemplates that the court determining the appeal has, in the usual way, ordered the respondent to pay the appellant's costs of the appeal. The Suitors' Fund Act does not make the appellant a party to the application by the respondent for the certificate. In my judgment, upon the true construction of the Suitors' Fund Act, the right of a respondent to an indemnity certificate arises after the determination of the appeal, if it succeeds. The right is determined in an application separate from and subsequent to the appeal. If there is any party, other than the unsuccessful party to the appeal in that application, that party could possibly be the Under Secretary of the Department of the Attorney-General and of Justice, but not the successful party to the appeal. Whether the Under Secretary could be a party depends upon the true effect of s. 4 of the Suitors' Fund Act. It is not necessary here to express any opinion on that question. It follows that this appeal to the High Court from the judgment of the Full Court on the motion for a new trial did not bring within the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court the discretion, which the Full Court of New South Wales would have had, to grant or refuse an indemnity certificate, if that motion had succeeded there. I would refuse the application. (at p116)

In this appeal three questions were argued with regard to the issue of the debentures the subject of this suit. The first question was whether there was a disinterested quorum of directors at either of the meetings of 3rd and 17th November. Art. 119 provides that two shall form a quorum at meetings of the board of directors and art. 112 in effect says that no director shall vote upon any matter in which he shall be interested. Its object was to ensure to the company that its directors should not be placed in a position in which their personal interests might be in conflict with the duty they owed to the company, and that in all transactions entered into by them on behalf of the company, the company should be able to rely upon their unbiassed and independent judgment (Victors Ltd. v. Lingard[8]). A disinterested quorum was not present at the meeting of 3rd November. But at the meeting of 17th November the minutes recorded that the quorum included Baker and Alldritt, both of whom had no personal interest in the issue of the debentures. Baker denied that he had been present but a mass of evidence was presented to the learned judge who found on this issue that Baker was present. "Upon questions of fact an appeal court will not interfere with the decision of the judge who has seen the witnesses and has been able, with the impression thus formed fresh in his mind, to decide between their contending evidence, unless there is some good and special reason to throw doubt upon the soundness of his conclusions" (Ruddy v. Toronto Eastern Railway Co.[9], and other cases cited in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Clarke[10]). After a careful consideration of the relevant evidence I have not found reasons adverse to the conclusion come to by the learned judge who has seen and heard the witnesses and determined the case upon comparison of their evidence. It was next contended on behalf of the appellant that no effective resolution had been passed to authorize the issue of the debentures, firstly, because no competent quorum was present at the meeting of 3rd November, and secondly, because the resolution passed at the meeting of 17th November was merely ancillary and incidental to that of the previous meeting. The first resolution can only be considered for the purpose of interpreting the second resolution. The second resolution so construed represents that the series of debentures has been prepared and is in order awaiting authority to issue the series and then proceeds to determine upon and authorize its issue. The last objection to the judgment under appeal was that the power had not been exercised by the directors "bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole." At the hearing before the learned judge the plaintiff accepted the onus of proving this proposition. The phrase "bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole" no doubt tends to become a cant expression in these matters but is not yet a shibboleth. Many of the cases which illustrate this "phrase" relate to the alteration of articles of association by shareholders in general meeting. No court "should consider itself fettered by the form of words, as if it were a phrase in an Act of Parliament which must be accepted and construed as it stands" (Shuttleworth v. Cox Brothers & Co. (Maidenhead)[11]). But the learned judge found that "the evidence as a whole preponderates in favour of the view that in regard to the issue of debentures the directors acted in the interests of the company and of the general body of shareholders and not in the interests of the proposed debenture holders" and found this issue of fact against the plaintiff. In order to succeed in a case like the present the plaintiff must prove the equivalent of fraud or bad faith. In Hirsche v. Sims[12] the Earl of Selborne formulated a test which seems applicable to the present case as follows: "If the true effect of the whole evidence is, that the defendants truly and reasonably believed at the time that what they did was for the interest of the company, they are not chargeable with dolus malus or breach of trust merely because in promoting the interest of the company they were also promoting their own." Upon such a question an opportunity of seeing the parties concerned is a matter of special importance in arriving at a conclusion. In the present case it is enough to say that the evidence does not establish any reason for disturbing the finding of the learned judge to which I have referred.

The appeal should be dismissed.

In this case I am not prepared to dissent from the conclusion of the court that the appeal should be allowed.

I do not wish to derogate in the least degree from the judgment of Cussen J. in the case of Bank of Victoria Ltd. v. Mueller[19], which contains a valuable exposition of equitable doctrine and a discussion and explanation of authorities which have caused much confusion. But I agree that the facts fall short of establishing the necessary foundation of fact.

There are three cardinal matters of fact which cause me to concur in allowing the appeal. The first is that I do not think the respondent acted under the undue influence of her husband or was positively deceived by him or that her will was improperly overborne by him. The transaction does not seem to have been to the advantage of the Jones couple, and it may well be that the husband's enthusiasm was produced by something besides his own foolishness. It is true that in obtaining his wife's concurrence in the transaction to which he had committed himself he acted with less consideration for her interests than chivalry, not to say propriety, demanded, and it is probable that in committing himself to the purchase he wished to create a situation which would cause her some feeling of reluctance or even of embarrassment in refusing her subsequent concurrence. But I do not think that facts were established which would as between him and her create an equity sufficient to avoid the dealing if it had been confined to themselves. In the second place, I do not think that the appellants and their solicitors are shown to have so acted as to be bound by equities arising out of his conduct going only to her comprehension of the transaction. Having regard to what had occurred before the meeting at which the documents were executed, I am unable to say that the steps taken to explain the documents were insufficient. In the third place, I do not think that a case was made and proved on the part of the respondent wife that in executing the document she acted in the belief that the solicitors were advising her or her husband as well as the appellants and were protecting her interests. The case is a hard one, but I do not think that at law or in equity the respondent is able to say non haec in foedera veni.

I therefore concur in allowing the appeal.

This appeal turns on the interpretation of the will of William application to the events that have happened. The main difficulties relate to the operation of what may be called forfeiture clauses on alienation, bankruptcy, anticipation and the like. There is, however, a general preliminary question whether in these clauses "bankruptcy" is to be construed as relating to actual bankruptcy and as applying from the date it actually occurs or should be applied under the provisions concerning relation back: see s. 90 of the Bankruptcy Act 1924-1960 (Cth). I agree with Pape J. that one must take the date of actual bankruptcy. Unfortunately, one of the complications of the will is that it attempts to draw and maintain a distinction between capital and income, and speaking generally to provide for them quite separately. The result is to raise a question whether an anticipation which is alleged to have occurred leads to a forfeiture of income or also of capital. As a matter of surmise one might think that the policy of the provisions is to forfeit the interest of the beneficiary both in relation to capital and income on his attempting an anticipation. But after an attempt to reconcile the various provisions of the will I have come back to the conclusion that not only the conditions expressing the forfeiture but also the subject matter forfeited should be read in accordance with the canons of construction which require great strictness in such matters. In Peter v. Shipway [1908] HCA 52; (1908) 7 CLR 232, at p 255 , Isaacs J. denied that Randfield v. Randfield [1860] EngR 583; (1860) 8 HLC 225 (11 ER 414) established a rule of construction that where one portion of a will read by itself makes a clear and indefeasible gift, the Court, in the absence of other unambiguous words establishing beyond any possible doubt a limitation of that gift, is bound to deny defeasibility. No doubt that is true but I think one should be quite satisfied that the intention to defeat a gift extends to a particular property before the testamentary document is construed as imposing a condition on a devise or bequest otherwise made. In the present case there are no definite words which bring about this result in the case of corpus after an attempted anticipation. Guided in no small degree by this consideration I agree on this point with the view expressed in the judgment of Kitto J. which I have had the advantage of reading, rather than with the view on this point adopted by Pape J. I therefore agree in the conclusion expressed in his judgment by Kitto J. that the order under appeal should be varied by substituting for the answer to the first question contained in the order the simple answer No. From that it follows that no question arises under the second and third questions in the summons. (at p601)

2. For the answer contained in the order to the fourth question in the summons, namely, the question what person or persons are entitled and in what shares and proportions to the part of the estate of the testator referred to in the will of the testator as the corpus of the estate, I think that there should be substituted the answer suggested by his Honour, namely, the defendant Harry Bucklow became on 17th July 1960 absolutely entitled to the whole of the beneficial interest in the testator's estate, subject to any right or interest created by him and then subsisting in favour of the defendant Phairs Pty. Ltd. or any other company or person. (at p601)

3. The order for the appointment of the representative party and the order for costs should remain unaltered. (at p601)

In cases concerning the interpretation of wills one generally finds oneself overwhelmed by a sea of authorities not quite reconcilable with each other. One then is not only called upon to find a path through the wilderness of decisions but to ascertain the intention of the testator from the words he has used. Unless the cases lay down some principle or canon of construction they serve no good purpose. The use of a word or expression in one context is of no help in interpreting the same word or expression in a different context. In the instant case my brother Dixon has dealt faithfully with the authorities and adopted an interpretation of the will, and codicil, which accords with my own.

I agree with his reasons and with the order proposed by him.

In this suit four medical officers of the Repatriation Department seek declarations of right which will fix the amounts of their respective standard annual salaries. (at p35)

2. They are entitled under an amended determination made by the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator to standard annual salaries to which the cost of living adjustments are added. The amended determination fixed ranges of salaries for a list of offices which it named including offices which the plaintiffs occupied. This was done by fixing for each office an annual minimum and an annual maximum salary and a rate of increment. The addition of a given number of increments would bring the annual minimum salary up to the annual maximum salary. Before the amended determination came into operation the rates of remuneration of the plaintiffs were governed by an instrument similarly fixing for each of the offices occupied by the plaintiffs respectively an annual minimum and an annual maximum salary and a rate of increment. The increments were annual. By the date as from which the determination became applicable in the ascertainment of the plaintiffs' remuneration, their salaries under the previous instrument had all advanced by annual increments from the minimum rates prescribed. Some had advanced through the salary range to the maximum rates; some not so far. It is hardly necessary to say that the new minimum and maximum rates for standard salaries fixed by the amended determination are higher than the old. The plaintiffs' contention is that in applying the new rates to them they should be treated as having already advanced in the same way through or within the new salary range prescribed for the offices they occupy. Thus if a plaintiff had advanced through the old salary range belonging to his office by increments to the maximum rate, he does not, so the plaintiffs say, begin in the new salary range at the minimum but he goes from the old maximum rate to the new maximum rate. If he had, by what the determination calls incremental advancement, reached the second increment, so that his annual standard salary consisted under the former instrument of the minimum rate and two increments, then under the new determination his salary would be calculated on the same footing, namely by adding to the new minimum rate two increments at the new rate of increment. Presumably if an officer had become entitled to one or more increments and had also served some months of a year at the end of which he would have received another increment, the contention would apply to him so as to place him in the same position under the new determination and give him the same number of increments to the new rate of salary at once and the next increment at the same future date, namely at the end of the year some months of which he had already served.

3. The Commonwealth contests this view of the application of the new determination and maintains that the new range of salaries simply provides for each office a lower and an upper limit and a rate of increment; where the officer is placed within the range is a matter for the Public Service Board. According to the Commonwealth, so far as the plaintiff's legal rights under the amended determination are concerned, they cannot claim to be placed in receipt of more than the new minimum. But the application of the Commonwealth's interpretation of the amended determination to the plaintiffs is so to speak intercepted and limited by a further feature of the case which is independent of the determination. That feature is found in the circumstance that pending the amended determination the plaintiffs were transferred from the employment of the Repatriation Commission which they had been serving to the Department of Repatriation, that is to the Public Service. This was done by or under Act No. 1 of 1947, which inserted in the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1922-1946 ss. 81Y and 81Z. The latter section in effect entitles an officer so transferred to a salary at the rate applicable to him immediately before the date of the transfer. In consequence of this provision the Commonwealth does not contend that the Public Service Board could place an officer upon a new minimum if it would result in his receiving less than his old salary under the Commission. (at p36)

4. From this account of the question between the parties it is now necessary to turn to the instruments containing the materials upon which the question must be decided. (at p36)

5. At the time as at which the amended determination took effect the rates of salary and of increments and the relevant conditions affecting the plaintiffs were contained in the Repatriation (Staff) Regulations: S.R. 1941 No. 259 as affected by S.R. 1944 No. 11, S.R. 1946 No. 16 and No. 100. In the third schedule to these regulations the standard salaries of the various offices of the second division of the Repatriation Commission's staff are set out. The offices held by the four plaintiffs were all within the second division. They held the following offices respectively: - Dr. Allen, Senior Medical Officer South Australia; Dr. McKay, Assistant Senior Medical Officer Victoria; Dr. Hayes, Medical Officer Branch Office; Dr. Knight, Medical Officer Branch Office. The third schedule showed the standard salaries for these offices thus: -

    ------------------------------------------------------------------.
    Designation and Location | Standard Salary Range
    of Office |----------------------------------------.
    | Minimum | Maximum | Increments
    ------------------------------------------------------------------.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------.
    | Per annum | Per annum | Per annum
    | pounds | pounds | pounds
    Seni showed the standard salaries for these offices thus:-
    South Australia | | |
    | | |

    Assistant Senior Medical | 962 | 1,062 | 50
    Officer Victoria | | |
    | | | 36 pounds where
    Medical Officer Branch | 720 | 960 | rate of
    Offices | | | salary is
    | | | under 864 pounds.
    | | | 48 pounds where
    | | | rate of
    | | | salary is
    | | | 864 pounds or
    | | | over.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------.

(at p37)

6. The following regulations provided for the application of this schedule: - "17 - (1.) The limits of standard salary payable to an officer of the Second Division shall be the limits respectively specified in Columns 2 and 3 of the Third Schedule to these Regulations opposite to the designation of his office in Column 1 of that Schedule. (2.) The amount which may, subject to the provisions of regulation 22 of these Regulations, be paid to an officer of the Second Division by way of an increment of salary shall be the amount specified in Column 4 of the Third Schedule to these Regulations opposite to the designation of his office in Column 1 of that Schedule." "22 - (1.) Increments of salary which are prescribed within the salary limits of any particular office shall be annual except where the Commission otherwise determines, and no increment shall accrue to any salary until the officer in receipt of the salary has received the salary for a period of twelve months. (2.) The right to receive an increment in any year shall depend upon the good conduct, diligence and efficiency of the officer and his period of attendance for duty during that year. (3.) If, in the opinion of the Deputy Commissioner, an officer is not entitled to receive an increment from the due date, the Deputy Commissioner shall forthwith notify the Commission of the circumstances, and the Commission may order that the officer be deprived of the increment for such time as the Commission considers justified." At the date as at which the amended determination took effect Dr. Allen was in receipt of a standard salary of the maximum amount of 1,162 pounds, having received three increments; Dr. McKay was in receipt of a standard salary of the maximum amount 1,062 pounds, having received two increments; Dr. Hayes was in receipt of a standard salary of 864 pounds, having received four annual increments of 36 pounds upon the minimum salary of 720 pounds; and Dr. Knight was in receipt of a standard salary of 828 pounds, having received three increments of 36 pounds. The date as at which the amended determination took effect was 24th April 1947. But it did so retrospectively, having been actually made, as amended, on 28th August 1947 and not coming into binding force until 16th November 1947. In the meantime, namely on 1st September 1947, the transfer from the Repatriation Commission to the Public Service took effect. The amended determination states that the rates of pay and other conditions of service should be as in a table it proceeds to set out. So far as concerns the offices the plaintiffs occupy, the table is as follows: -

    RATES OF PAY
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------.
    | | Range of Salary
    Office | Grade |-----------------------------------.
    | | | | Rate of
    | | Minimum | Maximum | Increment
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------.
    | | Per annum | Per annum |
    | | pounds | pounds |
    Senior Medical Officer | | 1,262 | 1,412 | 50
    South Australia | | | |
    Assistant Senior Medical | | 1,262 | 1,412 | 50
    Officer Victoria | | | |
    Medical Officers Branch | | 790 | 1,062 | 2 of 36
    Office | | | | 3 of 50
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------.

All this appears in clause 1 (1) of the determination. Correcting a clerical error, clause 3 is as follows: - "3 Increments. Officers shall be eligible for incremental advancement at the rates specified in clause 1 (1) in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Repatriation (Staff) Regulations." (at p39)

7. The case for the plaintiffs is that the table in the amended determination meant to do no more than write in, opposite the names of their respective offices, new and higher figures and that these would be applicable to the existing circumstances of each individual occupying one of those offices just as the figures replaced by the new amounts had been. Thus, as Dr. Allen had passed by incremental advancement, to use the expression employed by the determination, to the maximum salary named in the third schedule to the Regulations, so the new maximum salary named for his office in the table in clause 1 (1) of the amended determination applied to his case. In lieu of the maximum standard salary of 1,162 pounds per annum he would thus receive the new maximum standard salary 1,412 pounds. As Dr. McKay had passed by incremental advancement to the old maximum standard salary for his office of 1,062 pounds the new maximum for that office of 1,412 pounds would, according to the plaintiffs, apply to him. As Dr. Hayes had obtained four increments upon the former minimum standard salary for his office of 720 pounds he, so it was said, stood in a position entitling him under the amended determination to a standard salary consisting of the new minimum for his office of 790 pounds with four increments, two of 36 pounds and two of 50 pounds, that is 962 pounds. Another increment would have accrued to him on 4th January 1948 under the third schedule to the Regulations. Accordingly it is claimed that on that date he became entitled to a further increment under the amended determination. As Dr. Knight's incremental advancement had put him in a position of receiving a standard salary composed of the minimum for his office and three increments, an annual amount of 828 pounds, his salary under the amended determination would, according to the plaintiffs, be similarly composed of the new minimum of 790 pounds and three increments, two of 36 pounds and one of 50 pounds, an amount of 912 pounds. (at p39)

8. All this is denied on the part of the Commonwealth as based on an interpretation of the amended determination which there is nothing in the text to justify. The case for the Commonwealth is that the amended determination means only to prescribe minimum and maximum rates and increments. It says nothing and implies nothing as to the place within the salary range where any individual will stand as on the date from which it operates. On the contrary clause 3 of the amended determination incorporates reg. 22 and that regulation, so the Commonwealth says, in terms disentitles an officer in receipt of a salary from any increment until he has received the salary for twelve months. The salary must, says the Commonwealth, mean the minimum rate. In its application of reg. 22, required by clause 1 (1), to the new rates, so the Commonwealth contends, reg. 22 means that the then existing occupants of the respective offices should receive the new minimum at first. Accordingly if it were not for the controlling effect of s. 81z of the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1922-1947 (inserted by No. 1 of 1947) the Commonwealth might have placed Dr. Allen upon the minimum standard salary of his office or 1,262 pounds; Dr. McKay upon the new minimum standard salary of his office or 1,262 pounds; Dr. Hayes upon the new minimum standard salary of his office or 790 pounds, that is 74 pounds less than he was receiving; Dr. Knight upon the new minimum standard salary of his office or 790 pounds, 38 pounds less than he was receiving. I am not prepared to accept so much of the argument for the Commonwealth as depends on the operation ascribed to reg. 22 in its application to the amended determination. Clause 3 of the amended determination gives the provisions of reg. 22 an application with reference to the eligibility of officers for incremental advancement at the rates of increment specified in the new table. But that appears to me to mean that the provisions of reg. 22 shall be used for the purpose of determining an officer's title to future increments. I do not think that it is concerned with the ascertainment of the immediate salary to which the new amended determination entitled an officer as on the date of its taking effect. Clause 3 incorporates reg. 22 by reference for the purpose of determining "eligibility for incremental advancement." That means advancement in the future from the salary to which the amended determination entitled an officer as on the date of its taking effect. If it were correct that an intention was disclosed by clause 1 (1) and the table it contains to prescribe for the occupant of an office a new initial salary calculated on the basis of the incremental advancement he had already made under the Regulations, I would see nothing in the operation clause 3 gives to reg. 22 inconsistent with that intention. In that case reg. 22 would have served its purpose in the determination of the incremental advancement the officer had made in the past under the Regulations. It would have been used to fix his position. Its only use resulting from its incorporation by clause 3 would be in the determination of his future advance from that position. (at p40)

9. But what appears to me to be the crux upon which the case hangs is the absence of anything in the amended determination which expresses any intention upon the question whether or not the new table is, so to speak, to be fitted upon the occupants of the various offices in their then respective states of incremental advancement. There is nothing in the amended determination which adverts in any way to the difference between an officer who had obtained some or all of the increases of salary by which he would progress through the old salary range and an officer who had obtained none of them. There is only a bare statement that the rates of pay and other terms and conditions of service should be as set out and then the new table. For the plaintiffs to make out their claim that the amended determination meant the new table to be applied to the officers of the service on the footing that the stages of former incremental advancement made by each should be recognized as the basis for calculating the new initial standard salaries, it is necessary for them to point to some sufficient indications in the instrument of such an intention or to rely upon necessary implication. In the instrument itself I cannot find any indications from which the intention could be safely deduced. Within the salary ranges there are no subdivisions, grades or steps amounting to a distinct status or position which an officer might be considered as occupying, and that is true equally of the old third schedule and of the new table. There is nothing but a standard salary range from minimum to maximum and a money rate of increment. Regulation 22 dealt with no more than the conditions of the officers' qualified right or expectation of increment. (at p41)

10. To my mind the plaintiffs are forced to rely upon an implied intention. It must be implied if at all from the structure of the table, the existence and structure of the previous schedule, the extent and nature of the service including the certainty that officers would have already moved in different degrees within the old limits of standard salary, the general circumstances surrounding the making of the determination and perhaps an accepted administrative or arbitral practice, if any there were, in applying awards, determinations and tables similarly constructed. As to this last possible element investigation showed that for over thirty-five years similarly constructed tables have been used for various purposes in the Public Service. The same question must have arisen before when changes in the salary ranges have been made. But the plaintiffs were not able to show any practice in applying the instruments in the Public Service which would support the implication they seek, though it was claimed that the Repatriation Commission had applied the schedule and table in conformity with the interpretation for which the plaintiffs contend. (at p41)

11. An examination of the circumstances surrounding the making of the determination fails to reveal more than that the amended determination was in the end the result of agreement. But from that I think nothing can be deduced except that both parties were prepared to accept the table quantum valeat. (at p42)

12. To imply an intention of the kind now in question there must be a reasonable degree of certainty that it was so intended or that it is a necessary or rational consequence to be deduced from the nature of the instrument, the provisions it contains and the situation in which the parties concerned stood. (at p42)

13. After consideration I have come to the conclusion that in the materials before us no sufficient grounds can be found for implying the intention upon which the plaintiffs' case depends. (at p42)

14. Little is to be gained by discussing the remaining considerations urged in support of an implication. They consisted really in a claim that a full and practical understanding of the situation upon which the determination was meant to operate and of the character of the determination was the source of an inference in favour of the intention sufficiently vehement to warrant the making of the implication. It is not difficult to see how the plaintiffs come to place such a complexion upon the arbitral instrument. But it is to my mind a speculative inference resting on no firm ground. There is no cogent logical basis for it: nothing to warrant a legal implication. I think that the suit should be dismissed. But having regard to the issues raised by reason of par. 10 of the defence and the matters raised before McTiernan J. by the defendants and to the nature and source of the controversy I think that we should not award costs to the defendants. (at p42)

 I agree. I think that the attributes of the appellant by which Mr. Ward endeavoured to show that it is "a public authority" do not establish that proposition. It is necessary that an entity which claims to be a public authority for the purpose of this provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act should be constituted under statute and that it should also be given by statute powers or duties to be exercised for public objects. (at p23)

2. The appellant is licensed by the Licensing Act to sell alcoholic liquor. A licence is not in the ordinary sense a statutory power given to the licensee to act on behalf of the public. A liquor licence is a permission without which it would be illegal for the holder of the licence or anyone else to sell liquor. (at p24)

3. The appellant is managed by a publicly elected committee and bound by its constitution to devote the profits to public objects, but that does not necessarily make it a public authority constituted under statute. It is the nature of the authority which is the test, and that must be considered. (at p24)

4. This appellant is not given any powers, duties or authorities which would make it a public authority in the ordinary sense of the expression. It does not appear to be in a position which is in any relevant way different from the position it would hold in respect of the Act if it were licensed to sell a commodity other than liquor; a commodity which the law requires a trader to have a licence to sell. All that can be said about it is that the licence which is granted to it was granted to it in a special way and that the conduct of the business which the existence of that licence rendered lawful, is subject to special legislative rules. I agree with the reasons of his Honour the Chief Justice. (at p24)

. The purpose of this appeal by a defendant is to obtain a new his next friend in which a verdict for the plaintiff for 2,000 pounds was found. The injuries were sustained by the plaintiff on 1st May 1954. He appears to have been born on 23rd May 1947, so that he then would be almost seven years of age. He was knocked over by a car in front of the War Memorial at Dee Why. The car was not insured and the action was brought against the Nominal Defendant in pursuance of s. 30 (1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act 1942-1951 (N.S.W.). The defendant called no evidence but the case he sought to make was that the plaintiff was playing with other children and ran in front of the car probably after a ball. The trial took place more than four and a half years after the accident. There was not very much in the evidence called for the plaintiff to support the defendant's theory of the accident. The plaintiff lived near by and his story was that he went over to the monument and watched the children playing. There was a beach ball and he had kicked or thrown it to a girl, presumably on its coming his way, but he had not run on to the road. A boy about a year older than the plaintiff was called who said that he had walked to a structure with a platform which was at the site; the plaintiff was behind him. Some children were playing around it and a surf ball bounced from the platform. He saw a car coming and saw the plaintiff bending sideways to pick up the ball. He looked away and when he looked back the plaintiff was under the car. Under cross-examination however he answered that the ball had gone bouncing on to the road and that the plaintiff went on to the road to get it. Upon this, of course, the Nominal Defendant placed his reliance. (at p478)

2. A girl who at the time of the accident would have been thirteen years of age said that she had been playing with the ball but had put it under the stand. She was standing near some posts and the staging and suddenly found herself pinned by the car against the staging. She looked and saw the plaintiff on the ground. A youth a little older said that he heard the girl scream and looked. He saw the boy under the car. The plaintiff was cross-examined for the purpose of showing that he had had no memory of the accident and that his account of it was the result of coaching by his father who had written out answers for him to learn. A doctor who gave evidence of the plaintiff's condition said that the plaintiff had said six months before the trial that he had no recollection of the details of the accident. (at p478)

3. To rebut the suggestion that the plaintiff's account of the accident was an afterthought reconstructed for the purpose of the litigation the plaintiff's counsel tendered a statement which a sergeant of police had obtained from the boy two months after the accident. The statement was objected to but was admitted in evidence. The new trial is sought by the Nominal Defendant upon the ground that the statement was inadmissible. It contained an account of the accident expressed in two sentences viz.: "About 11.20 a.m. on 1st May 1954 I walked up the roadway from Dee Why Surf Club and stood about six feet from the gutter in the Strand at Howard Avenue. I was looking at the grandstand and all I know is I was knocked down." (at p479)

4. No doubt the strength of the defendant's contention lay in the evidence of the youth who said that the ball had gone bouncing on to the road and the plaintiff had gone on to the road to get it. If the jury were minded not only to regard this as a correct account of the occurrence but also to treat it as negativing liability in the defendant one may be permitted to doubt whether they could have been in the least influenced to the contrary by the brief allusion in the plaintiff's statement to his having stood about six feet from the gutter in the Strand looking at the grandstand. In all the circumstances of the case the contention that the statement ought not to have been admitted seemed a somewhat flimsy ground for a new trial application. On the other hand I have had some doubt whether the conduct of the trial by counsel for the defendant really gave sufficient ground for letting in the statement as evidence. The rule of evidence under which it was let in is well recognized and of long standing. If the credit of a witness is impugned as to some material fact to which he deposes upon the ground that his account is a late invention or has been lately devised or reconstructed, even though not with conscious dishonesty, that makes admissible a statement to the same effect as the account he gave as a witness if it was made by the witness contemporaneously with the event or at a time sufficiently early to be inconsistent with the suggestion that his account is a late invention or reconstruction. But, inasmuch as the rule forms a definite exception to the general principle excluding statements made out of court and admits a possibly self-serving statement made by the witness, great care is called for in applying it. The judge at the trial must determine for himself upon the conduct of the trial before him whether a case for applying the rule of evidence has arisen and, from the nature of the matter, if there be an appeal, great weight should be given to his opinion by the appellate court. It is evident however that the judge at the trial must exercise care in assuring himself not only that the account given by the witness in his testimony is attacked on the ground of recent invention or reconstruction or that a foundation for such an attack has been laid by the party but also that the contents of the statement are in fact to the like effect as his account given in his evidence and that having regard to the time and circumstances in which it was made it rationally tends to answer the attack. It is obvious that it may not be easy sometimes to be sure that counsel is laying a foundation for impugning the witness's account of a material incident or fact as a recently invented, devised or reconstructed story. Counsel himself may proceed with a subtlety which is the outcome of caution in pursuing what may prove a dangerous course. That is one reason why the trial judge's opinion has a peculiar importance. (at p480)

5. In the present case counsel for the Nominal Defendant disclaimed any attack on the honesty of the plaintiff's account of the accident. But although upon the evidence as recorded it is difficult to feel assured that a foundation had been laid for an attack upon the boy's story as a late reconstruction it was, I think, fairly open to the judge at the trial to conclude that the defendant would set up a case that the plaintiff's story was the result of the father's coaching and represented no antecedent memory of the events, and that is perhaps enough. But there is yet another difficulty. For after all the statement to the police sergeant says very little and might be explained not altogether unreasonably as the kind of thing a policeman might put down after obtaining but the barest account of the accident from a child, who ex hypothesi had little or no recollection of the event in detail. But that apparently was not the view taken at the trial by either party. (at p480)

6. On the whole I am not prepared to overrule the view of the judge at the trial and in any event, as appears from what I have already said, I do not feel disposed to attach the same importance to the document as the defendant has done in supporting his appeal. In the result I think the appeal should be dismissed. (at p480) D

In my opinion these applications should be refused. Since the hearing I have studied with some care the argument in support of the applications and considered the points made. I think they are fully answered by the judgment prepared by Taylor and Owen JJ. which also sets out fully the facts of the case. In that judgment I concur, subject to the following observations. I do not think that the confessional statements made by the prisoners were obtained in any way unlawfully or improperly. I think that on the facts they were quite voluntary. It is therefore unnecessary to deal with the controversial question whether evidence which is relevant should be rejected on the ground that it is come by unlawfully or otherwise improperly. I do not think that in this or any other jurisdiction the question has been put at rest by Kuruma v. The Queen (1955) AC 197 : see postscript at p. 103 of Essays on the Law of Evidence, Cowen and Carter (1956). Those interested in the question will find much information in the judgment of Frankfurter J. in Wolf v. Colorado [1949] USSC 101; (1949) 338 US 25, at pp 28, 29, 39 [1949] USSC 101; [1949] USSC 101; (93 Law Ed 1782, at pp 1786, 1791 (Table J.)). which suggests that the British view is that public policy does not prevail over relevancy. (at p562)

2. The second matter I wish to refer to is the view that in order to render a confessional statement admissible in evidence it must be established beyond reasonable doubt that it was made voluntarily. I am not prepared to say what are the limits of the application of general propositions laid down in Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1935] UKHL 1; (1935) AC 462 , but I think that it is a mistake to transfer the principle from its application to the issues before the jury to incidental matters of fact which the judge must decide. In that connexion I may add that I do not quite understand what the late Starke J. meant by the statement in Sinclair v. The King (1946) 73 CLR, at p 328 when he said that a judge was entitled and bound to consider the probability of the mental condition (scil. of the prisoner) affecting the truth of a confession in all the circumstances of the case and to decide whether there was prima facie reason for presenting it to the jury. It appears to me that once it was established that a prisoner understood what he was doing in making a statement which, if true, would amount to a confession, it is admissible in evidence quite independently of its probative value. See the discussion in Sinclair's Case (1946) 73 CLR, at pp 336-338 . I do not think really that probative value is ever a question for the judge to decide conclusively. At all events I am not able to call to mind any conditions in which it would be. (at p562)

3. The applications for leave to appeal should be dismissed. (at p563)

This action is brought in the original jurisdiction of the Act 1906-1950 (Cth). This section, which is in Pt II of the Act, provides that any person who is injured in his person or property by any other person, by reason of any act or thing done by that other person in contravention of this Part of this Act, or by reason of any act or thing done in contravention of any injunction granted under this Part of this Act, may, in the High Court, before a Justice without a jury, sue for and recover treble damages for the injury. Section 3 of the Act provides that "person" includes corporation. Section 14, which is in Pt II, provides, by sub-s. (1), that no proceeding for an indictable offence or for the recovery of penalties shall be instituted under this Part except by the Attorney-General or some person authorized by him, and, by sub-s. (2), that no other proceeding shall be instituted under this Part without the written consent of the Attorney-General. (at p69)

2. The action is a proceeding to which s. 14 (2) is applicable, because it is not a proceeding which falls within s. 14 (1). The action was commenced by a writ of summons which was issued on 27th January 1967 from the Adelaide Registry of the High Court. The writ was issued at the instance of John Robertson & Co. Ltd. (In liquidation), the plaintiff, against five defendants, which included a defendant of the name of Philips Electrical Pty. Ltd., but not of the name of Philips Industries Pty. Ltd. An endorsement was made on the writ before it was issued. The endorsement was made pursuant to O. 2 r. 1. The endorsement read thus:

    "The plaintiff claims -
    Under the provisions of s. 11 of the Australian Industries
    Preservation Act 1906-1950 and the exercise of the jurisdiction
    thereby conferred on this Honourable Court that this Honourable
    Court award to it the sum of $76,361.25 being treble
    damages for the injury done to it by reason of the acts of the
    defendants and each of them in refusing to supply or sell to it
    fluorescent lamp ballasts or alternatively such ballasts of the
    type known as 'code ballasts' from 20th November 1961 and
    thereafter at any prices other than the prices fixed by the
    defendants -
    (a) pursuant to a contract entered into among themselves the
    defendants were and continued to be members and in which
    each of the defendants was and continued to be engaged
    which contract and combination were in relation to trade
    and commerce among the States of the Commonwealth of
    Australia and were in restraint of trade and commerce or
    alternatively were made entered into and engaged in and
    continued so to be with intent to restrain trade and
    commerce in contravention of the provisions of Pt. II of
    the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1950 and
    in particular of the provisions of s. 4 thereof and
    (b) by reason of the defendants and each of them monopolizing
    or alternatively attempting to monopolize and combining
    and conspiring with each other to monopolize part of trade
    and commerce among the said States namely trade and
    commerce with respect to the sale of fluorescent ballasts
    or alternatively the sale of such ballasts of the type known
    as code ballasts in contravention of the said Pt II of the
    said Australian Industries Preservation Act and in particular
    s. 7 thereof.
    The Attorney-General has pursuant to s. 14 of the said Act
    given written consent to the institution of these proceedings.
    AND THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS treble damages.
    In pursuance of s. 14 of the Australian Industries Preservation
    Act 1606-1950 I NIGEL BOWEN, M.P. the Attorney-General of
    the Commonwealth of Australia hereby consent to the institution
    of an action in the High Court of Australia by the within
    Writ of Summons."

The plaintiff delivered a statement of claim in which the plaintiff's claim is fully pleaded, but there is no allegation altering the nature of the claim endorsed on the writ. (at p70)

3. On 30th September 1971 the High Court made an order providing that "pursuant to O. 16 r. 4 Philips Electrical Pty. Ltd. be struck out as a party improperly joined and that the name of Philips Industries Pty. Ltd. be added as a party defendant in the cause". The writ and statement of claim were amended in accordance with this order. The amended writ and statement of claim purport to be sealed with the seal of the High Court Adelaide Registry (see High Court Procedure Act 1903-1950, s. 3 (4)). Before the amended writ and statement of claim were sealed the Attorney-General gave his consent pursuant to s. 14 to the joinder of Philips Industries Pty. Ltd. as a defendant in the action. The form in which the consent was given is endorsed on the amended writ. The endorsement is as follows: "In pursuance of s. 14 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1950, I IVOR JOHN GREENWOOD, the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, hereby consent to the institution of an action in the High Court of Australia by the within writ of summons against Philips Industries Pty. Ltd." Philips Industries Pty. Ltd. entered an appearance in the action on 24th April 1972 in the Adelaide Registry and filed a statement of defence for itself. (at p71)

4. The plaintiff demurred to a number of paragraphs in the statement of defence filed by Philips Industries and also filed a reply. Philips Industries demurred to a paragraph of the plaintiff's reply. The demurrers of the plaintiff were set down before the Full Court and copies of the amended statement of claim, the statement of defence filed by Philips Industries, the plaintiff's reply, and the demurrer of Philips Industries are before us. Paragraph 26 of the defence of Philips Industries is the subject of the plaintiff's first demurrer. This paragraph is pleaded to par. 25 of the amended statement of claim. The only amendment made to the original statement of claim is that the name of Philips Electrical Industries Pty. Ltd. is replaced by the name of Philips Industries Pty. Ltd. The latter is the defendant to which I have referred by the name, Philips Industries, and to which I shall continue to refer. Paragraph 25 of the amended statement of claim is in these terms: "The Attorney-General has pursuant to the s. 14 of the said Act, given written consent to the institution of these proceedings." The reason why the plaintiff pleads this paragraph is that the Attorney-General's consent is by reason of s. 14 (2) a statutory condition precedent to any action by a plaintiff in the High Court claiming treble damages in pursuance of s. 11 (1). Paragraph 26 of the statement of defence of Philips Industries is a challenge only to the satisfaction of this condition precedent by the consent given by the Attorney-General to the institution of the action against this defendant. The material matter alleged by par. 26 of the defence of Philips Industries is the following: "... this suit is a proceeding within the meaning of s. 14 (2) of the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906 (as amended) and was instituted within the meaning of the said sub-section on 27th January 1967 and the Attorney-General did not consent in writing to the institution of proceedings against the defendant (Philips Industries Pty. Ltd.) before such institution of the said suit". The 2nd par. of the plaintiff's reply to par. 26 of the defence of Philips Industries is the subject of a demurrer on the part of this defendant. This paragraph consists of three sub-pars., (a), (b) and (c). Sub-paragraph (a) refers to the order made by this Court on 30th September 1971; sub-par. (b) says in substance that the consent of the Attorney-General endorsed on the writ after the order was made fulfils the condition precedent enacted by s. 14 (2), so far as the "institution of proceedings" against Philips Industries is concerned and further says that the consent was given on 24th January 1972; sub-par. (c) says that Philips Industries was added as a party to the action on 1st March 1972 when the seal of the High Court was affixed to the amended writ and statement of claim. The demurrer of Philips Industries is confined to sub-par. (b) of the 2nd par. of the plaintiff's reply. It is said in the demurrer that this sub-paragraph "does not answer the defence raised under par. 26 of the statement of defence to which it is pleaded in that the proceeding herein was instituted on 27th January 1967" and the said sub-par. (b) of the 2nd par. of the plaintiff's reply "does not allege that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia gave his written consent to the institution of any proceedings against the defendant Philips Industries Pty. Ltd. on or before that date". (at p72)

5. The demurrer of the plaintiff to par. 26 of the defence of Philips Industries (the words of this paragraph are set out above) is put on the ground that "the allegations therein do not disclose a good defence to the plaintiff's claim". (at p72)

6. I have arrived at the conclusion that the demurrer of Philips Industries to sub-par. (b) of the 2nd par. of the plaintiff's reply ought to be overruled and the demurrer of the plaintiff to par. 26 of the defence filed by this defendant ought to be allowed. (at p72)

7. As regards the demurrer by Philips Industries: for the purposes of this demurrer, it is necessary to assume that the matters set out in the 2nd par. of the plaintiff's reply are admitted by Philips Industries. In the first place it is clear that on these admitted facts the Attorney-General gave his consent pursuant to s. 14 to the instituting of the present action against Philips Industries. In order to uphold the demurrer by this defendant it would be necessary to decide that after the commencement, with the consent of the Attorney-General, of an action under s. 11 (1) or of any proceeding to which s. 14 (2) is applicable, no party not joined as a defendant at the time of the commencement of such action or proceeding could be lawfully added, by reason of s. 14 (2), as a party to the cause, even though the Attorney-General purported to consent pursuant to that sub-section to the instituting of the action or proceeding against such proposed party. In my opinion, to decide in this way would attribute more to the consent of the Attorney-General than s. 14 (2) intends. The sub-section enacts only that a proceeding to which it applies shall not be instituted without the written consent of the Attorney-General. In my opinion the effect of the Attorney-General's consent intended by the sub-section is to make the plaintiff competent under s. 14 (2) to initiate the proceeding - in other words to set it on foot. Where the Attorney-General has given his consent pursuant to the sub-section such consent does not operate to restrict a right of the plaintiff to join a party as a defendant, if the Attorney-General has consented to his doing so. The joinder of a party in conformity with the procedure of the Court may be properly described as instituting the proceeding against such party. There is no question that the consent of the Attorney-General first endorsed on the writ by which the proceeding was commenced remains effective for the purposes of s. 14 (2). In my opinion, the Attorney-General properly applied this sub-section by giving his consent, when he did so, to instituting the present action against Philips Industries. I would for these reasons allow the plaintiff's demurrer to par. 26 of the statement of defence of Philips Industries and disallow the latter's demurrer to sub-par. (b) of the 2nd par. of the plaintiff's reply to the said par. 26. (at p73)

8. By par. 27 of its statement of defence Philips Industries pleaded the following: "In further answer to the whole of the statement of claim this is an action for penalties, damages or sums of money given to the plaintiff by a statute in force at the commencement of the Limitation of Actions Act of 1936 and the said action was not commenced against the defendant within two years next after the alleged cause of action accrued." The statute to which this paragraph refers is the Limitation of Actions Act, 1936 (S.A.). By s. 37 it is provided that all actions for slander and all actions for penalties damages or sums of money given to any party by any statute in force at or after the commencement of this Act shall be commenced within two years next after the cause of action accrued, but not after. The present action was commenced within the State of South Australia and is pending in the Adelaide Registry of the High Court. Section 37 is pleaded as a bar to the action on the footing that it is a law of South Australia which is applicable to this case by virtue of s. 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903-1966 (Cth). This section provides that the laws of each State, including the laws relating to procedure, evidence, and the competency of witnesses, shall, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth, be binding on all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in that State in all cases to which they are applicable. The plaintiff demurred to par. 27 of the statement of defence of Philips Industries on the ground that s. 37 does not apply to proceedings instituted under the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1950 (Cth) and "as a consequence" the allegations contained in par. 27 of the said statement of defence "do not disclose a good defence to the plaintiff's claim". I think that the preliminary question is whether a proceeding under s. 11 (1) of the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1950 (Cth) falls within the following words of s. 37 of the Limitation of Actions Act, 1936 (S.A.), namely, "all actions for penalties damages or sums of money given to any party by any statute". This Act is, according to its long title, "An Act to consolidate the Acts relating to the limitation of actions and other legal proceedings". One of the Acts of which this Act is a consolidation is the Limitation of Suits and Actions Act, 1866-1867 (S.A.). Section 37 of the Limitations of Actions Act, 1936 (S.A.) is in the same terms as s. 38 of the former Act. In Mort v. Bradley (1916) SALR 129 , in which a petitioner claimed damages against the co-respondent under the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1867 (S.A.), Gordon J. decided that the word "damages" in s. 38 of the Limitation of Suits and Actions Act, 1866-1867 (S.A.) means damages in the nature of penalties, and does not extend to damages against a co-respondent guilty of adultery. This was a case referred for argument before the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia. Gordon J. was guided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Thomson v. Lord Clanmorris (1900) 1 Ch 718 on s. 3 of the Civil Procedure Act, 1833 (3 & 4 Will. 4, c. 42). This section provided, inter alia, that "all actions for penalties, damages or sums of money given to the party grieved by any statute" must be brought within two years after the cause of action. The Court of Appeal decided that the section refers to actions for penalties or damages or sums of money in the nature of penalties. That case was an action by a shareholder in a company under s. 3 of the Directors Liability Act, 1890 (53 & 54 Vict. c. 64) to recover from the directors of the company compensation for loss or damage sustained by the shareholder by reason of untrue statements in the prospectus of the company on the faith of which he subscribed for the shares. The Court of Appeal decided that s. 3 did not apply to the action. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the trial judge, who said in the course of his judgment (1899) 2 Ch 523, at p 528 , "although the words 'damages or sums of money given to the party grieved' occur in the statute, yet they are connected with a reference to actions for 'penalties,' and I think that this part of the section is aimed at actions for penalties, and means damages or sums of money in the nature of penalties, and not sums of money such as we are dealing with here, representing compensation for loss suffered by persons who have subscribed for shares on the faith of untrue statements in a prospectus". It was decided on appeal that the actions referred to in the part of s. 3 under consideration were penal actions. Section 37 contains no words that should lead to the conclusion that the actions for penalties, "damages or sums of money" to which the section refers are not all penal actions. I do not think it would be a correct construction of s. 37 to imply that what are called penalties or damages or sums of money have to be assessed with the view of compensating plaintiffs rather than punishing defendants. The only ground on which it is said that s. 11 (1) is within s. 37 of the Limitation of Actions Act, 1936 (S.A.) is that s. 11 (1) gives a right to sue for treble damages. This is not, in my opinion, within the class of action which was contemplated by s. 37. Section 11 (2) provides that no person shall, in any proceeding under this section, be excused from answering any question put either viva voce or by interrogatory, or from making any discovery of documents, on the ground that the answer or discovery may criminate or tend to criminate him; but his answer shall not be admissible in evidence against him in any criminal proceeding other than a prosecution for perjury. Section 11 (2) supports the view that a proceeding under s. 11 (1) is not a penal action. Whereas s. 11 (1) provides for the recovery by the person injured, of treble damages by a civil action, s. 13 (1) provides for the recovery of pecuniary penalties for offences against the same Part of the Act by way of civil action. There is, therefore, on the face of the Act, a distinction between "treble damages" and pecuniary penalty. In Redfern v. Dunlop Rubber Australia Ltd. (1964) 110 CLR 194 , the nature and purpose of the remedy of treble damages provided by s. 11 (1) was examined. Dixon C.J. said (1964) 110 CLR, at p 209 that "the theory" must be that a person injured by a contravention of the Act "might hesitate to sue if he had not the incentive of recovering three times his loss". Menzies J. (1964) 110 CLR, at p 223 expressed the view that treble damages are provided "for the compensation of those injured" by a contravention of the Act. Nothing is said in the case which could support the view that a proceeding under s. 11 (1) is a penal action. In my opinion, the present action is not within the class of actions contemplated by s. 37 of the Limitation of Actions Act, 1936 (S.A.). Section 37 may be described as a law relating to procedure. However, s. 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903-1966 (Cth) does not enable a defendant in the present case to plead that the present action is barred by s. 37 because on the true construction of s. 37 it is not applicable to a proceeding under s. 11 (1). I would accordingly uphold the plaintiff's demurrer to par. 27 of the statement of defence filed on behalf of Philips Industries. The plaintiff demurred also to par. 28 of the statement of defence of Philips Industries. This paragraph sets out in extenso what is alleged in the statement of claim in an action brought on 31st May 1962 by the present plaintiff against Philips Industries (then known as Philips Electrical Industries Pty. Ltd.) and in the subsequent pleadings, namely, statement of defence and reply. The paragraph concludes by alleging that the action was tried and that the Court awarded the plaintiff damages of 1,500 pounds. Paragraph 28 alleges that the action was brought to recover damages for breach of a contract dated 28th March 1961 to sell certain electrical ballasts by the defendant (Philips Electrical Industries Pty. Ltd.) to the present plaintiff. It is in effect alleged by par. 28 that an issue-estoppel arose from the adjudication of the Court awarding 1,500 pounds damages to the plaintiff. The estoppel is put by par. 28 in this way: "the plaintiff ought not to be admitted to say in par. 23 of the (amended) statement of claim and by the matters set out in the ... specific particulars of damage that it has been injured in its property by the defendants and each of them." The reason pleaded is that the plaintiff brought the previous action and was awarded damages as set out above. The estoppel is alleged to be raised in respect of each of the five defendants in this action. Paragraph 23 of the present amended statement of claim alleges that by reason of the acts alleged in previous paragraphs to have been done by the defendants, including Philips Industries, the plaintiff has been injured in its property by the defendants and each of such acts were alleged contraventions of s. 4 and s. 7 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1950 (Cth). Each of these sections creates an offence. These sections define the defences that may be pleaded in proceedings under those sections. In my opinion the reason alleged in par. 28 of the defence of Philips Industries for claiming that the plaintiff is estopped from alleging it was injured in its property by reason of the acts mentioned in such paragraph is bad in substance and in law. I am also of opinion that the adjudication of the Court in the previous action awarding the plaintiff 1,500 pounds does not raise an estoppel against the assessment of an amount in excess of that sum. The plaintiff was not entitled in that action to sue to recover treble damages for breach of contract. The present action is brought to recover damages for injury caused by acts and things which are offences against the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1950 (Cth). Compensation for injury, to which s. 11 (1) is applicable, was not assessable in the previous action. In my opinion it does not appear on the face of the pleadings in the present action that the plaintiff is suing for damages resulting merely from the breach of contract found in the previous action. Indeed, as it seems to me, the contrary is true. For the plaintiff makes allegations on which it sues for much larger damages, but gives credit in respect of 1,500 pounds. In my opinion, nothing is pleaded by par. 28 of the defence of Philips Industries in respect of any finding as to the quantum of damages at issue in the previous action which is a bar to the claim for treble damages in the present proceedings (cf. Crumbie v. Wallsend Local Board (1891) 1 QB 503, at p 508 ). (at p77)

9. I would allow the plaintiff's demurrer to par. 26 of the statement of defence of the defendant Philips Industries and disallow this defendant's demurrer to par. 2 (b) of the plaintiff's reply; and would allow the plaintiff's demurrer to pars. 27 and 28 respectively of the said defendant's statement of defence. (at p77)

The first argument advanced on behalf of the taxpayer was in fact employed in Aitken v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation[7] and is, I think, covered by that decision. The contention is based upon the view that for a given financial year there can be no accounting period substituted for the ordinary year of income until the commissioner has accepted for that financial year a return of the taxpayer based on the income of the accounting period, that is, until he has accepted the return either by assessing the taxpayer upon the return or in some other manner. If that were correct, either of two possible consequences might ensue in the application of sec. 62 (4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922-1934. The two possible applications of the proposed construction can be illustrated by the facts of the present case. It might be said that the last occasion upon which the return was so accepted was in relation to the income of the calendar year ended 31st December 1930, with the consequence that under the exemption in sub-sec. 4 the income was excluded which accrued or was derived during the period from that date until the death of the taxpayer on 26th June 1932. On the other hand, it might be said that sub-sec. 4 applied to exempt income from the 30th June preceding death unless returns for an accounting period had been accepted for the purpose of the financial year of tax following the date of death. In that case the income of the period from 30th June 1931 to 26th June 1932 would be exempt. But, in my opinion, the basis of the contention is mistaken and the answer to it already given by the Chief Justice is correct. The expression "accounting period" in sub-sec. 4 refers to recurring periods of time between the same dates in each accounting year fixed by the fact that the commissioner has at some time accepted a return for such a period and has not revoked his acceptance of that period for ensuing financial years.

The second of the contentions advanced on behalf of the taxpayer appears to me to be inconsistent with the construction which the court has given to sec. 62 (1). We have construed it as meaning, subject to the special exemption given in cases where estate duty is payable, to bring into tax the deceased's income right up to the day of his death, so that his executors or administrators are assessed for and liable to pay the same tax as he would pay were he still living. All income is made subject to tax for the financial year for which it is relevant having regard to the existence of an arrangement to accept an accounting period or the absence of any such arrangement. It might have been possible to construe sec. 62 as relating only to collection of tax for which a taxpayer who dies or the executor after him is elsewhere made liable. But that view did not meet with the approval of the court and the contrary view is that it is a section imposing liability and imposing liability upon the whole of the income right up to the day of the taxpayer's death, subject always to the special exemption given by sub-sec. 4.

The third ground relied upon does not appear to me to receive any support from the language in which the section is expressed. It is based upon the view that there could not be, or that it ought to be assumed there would not be, two independent sources of liability in the Act for the one tax. Thus it was said that, if, at the time of his death, a liability to taxation upon the income had been incurred by the deceased, the liability might descend to his executors but another liability to pay the same tax would not be independently imposed on them by sec. 62 (1). This abstract reasoning has no foundation and overlooks the fact that sec. 62 (1) endeavours to express in one statement what in the previous legislation was contained in more than one provision. It brought under liability to tax under a description expressed in one phrase the whole of what may be called the uncharged income of the deceased. It is not concerned whether a deceased had before the day of his death incurred a liability to taxation cognizable at law for such purposes as those which the court was considering in the two Western Australian cases, Commissioner of Stamps (W.A.) v. West Australian Trustee, Executor and Agency Co. Ltd.[8] and Commissioner of Stamps (W.A.) v. West Australian Trustee, Executor and Agency Co. Ltd.[9]. It imposes a direct liability upon the executors for tax upon the income which had not borne tax at the time of death. I may add that, in my opinion, the section charges them as executors so that their liability is as representatives and extends only to the assets of the deceased coming to their hands or which ought to come to their hands.

he substantial question which arises in the case stated is whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the payment of certain monies in English or Australian currency. The facts giving rise to this question can be stated in brief outline. In 1895 the Queensland Government decided to raise a loan by the issue of debentures secured upon the Consolidated Revenue of Queensland. The principal monies were payable on the 1st day of January 1945 either in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne or London at the option of the debenture holder and the holders were entitled to the amount payable thereunder in "pounds sterling." One further term of these debentures should be mentioned. While the principal sum was made payable in various places at the option of the holder, it was provided that notice should be given to the Treasurer of the Colony on or before the 1st day of July 1944 of the place at which it was intended to present the debentures for the payment of such sum. (at p607)

2. The debt of the then Colony of Queensland under these debentures was taken over by the Commonwealth pursuant to the Financial Agreement Act 1928, and the debenture holders received in place of their debentures Commonwealth inscribed stock maturing on the 1st January 1945. The plaintiffs now claim that they are entitled to be paid the amount of the stock held by them in London in English currency while the defendant claims to be entitled to repay this amount in Australian currency. (at p607)

3. The question for our consideration is one of the construction of this particular contract. When the contract was made in 1895 between the Colony and the debenture holders there was then both in England and Australia a common unit of account and a common unit of payment. The unit of payment i.e., pound sterling, was the same in England and Australia and it was obviously assumed that throughout the currency of the contract this state of affairs would remain. Between the date of the contract in 1895 and the date of repayment in 1945 changes occurred whereby the common unit of payment became disparate - in other words there came into existence two units of payment - an English pound and an Australian pound. (at p607)

4. In these circumstances little importance can be given to the use of the words "pounds sterling" in the original debentures. If the words "pounds sterling" had been used in a contract made after the time when Australian pounds were different from English pounds, it would be good ground for holding that the parties intended that the pounds sterling should be English pounds: cf. De Bueger v. J. Ballantyne & Co. Ltd. (1938) AC 452 . (at p607)

5. The position is that a situation has developed which the parties to the debentures never envisaged and the question to my mind which must be considered is whether any and what implication as a matter of law can be made in the new situation as to the form and means of payment to the plaintiffs. This rather suggests the problem relating to the question of frustration of contracts. (at p607)

6. In my opinion such an implication can be made depending substantially on the circumstances in which the debentures were issued. The original contracts between the Colony and the debenture holders were made pursuant to the statutory law of Queensland: the moneys repayable by these debentures to the holders were secured on the Consolidated Revenue of Queensland and the moneys so repayable were repayable in a currency which was the then currency of Queensland, as well as the currency of other parts of the Empire. Having regard to these considerations it should, I think, be implied that the proper law of these contracts was the law of Queensland and that the moneys repayable thereunder should be repaid in the then currency of Queensland. The implication of law to which I have referred entitled the State of Queensland, when the Australian pound came into existence, to pay the debenture holders in Australian pounds, and as the rights of the holders of the inscribed stock are agreed to be the same as or similar to the rights of the original debenture holders, the Commonwealth in my opinion is entitled to repay the holders of the inscribed stock in Australian currency. This conclusion substantially disposes of this case. (at p608)

7. Another matter was argued on behalf of the defendant, viz., that as the plaintiffs had not exercised the option mentioned in the debenture on or prior to 1st July 1944 they could not exercise an option requiring payment in London. The clause relating to this option could never have been intended to affect the rights of the debenture holders to receive payment of their principal sums whether in English or Australian currency and must be regarded as machinery for the convenience only of the borrower, and as not affecting the rights of the lenders to receive repayment of these sums in accordance with their substantial rights under their contract. (at p608)

8. I may add that on the facts of this case the plaintiffs are not entitled to interest. (at p608)

9. For these reasons I answer questions (a), (c) and (d), No and question (b), The principal sums are payable at the places mentioned in the debentures upon presentation of the inscribed stock as the rights of the registered holders of the stock "conformed in all respects with the rights conferred by the said Queensland Government debentures" (par. 2 of the case stated). (at p608)

The question for decision upon this appeal is whether an indenture made on 3rd July 1949 between the beneficiaries entitled to the residue of the estate of a testator named T.H. Buzza and the trustee of his will is liable to stamp duty as a settlement under par. IX. of the Third Schedule of the Stamps Act 1946-1949 (Vict.). The relevant portion of that paragraph, which is headed "Settlement or Gift, Deed of", is sub-par. (1). The instruments which it makes dutiable are described by the sub-paragraph thus:- "Any instrument other than a will or codicil whether voluntary or upon any good or valuable consideration other than a bona fide adequate pecuniary consideration and whether revocable or not whereby any property is settled or agreed to be settled in any manner whatsoever or is given or agreed to be given or directed to be given in any manner whatsoever, such instrument not being made before and in consideration of marriage". (at p296)

2. The provision has caused some difficulty because of the apparent self contradiction in the conception of a transaction which is a gift notwithstanding that it is upon a good or valuable consideration. But to an extent a reconciliation has been effected judicially between on the one hand the expressions "gift" and "given or agreed to be given" and on the other hand the expression "upon any good or valuable consideration other than a bona fide adequate pecuniary consideration". It has been done by treating the words "gift" and "given" as the dominant words and as importing benefaction as an element in the transaction and the words relating to consideration as meaning that, so long as it is not bona-fide adequate and pecuniary, the presence of consideration shall not be enough in itself to take the transaction out of the category of a gift. "The real meaning of the schedule is that a deed of gift shall not escape taxation merely because there is some good or valuable consideration therefor", per Hood J., Atkinson v. Collector of Imposts (1919) VLR 105, at p 113 . The matter was fully discussed in Collector of Imposts (Vict.) v. Cuming Campbell Investments Company [1940] HCA 17; [1940] HCA 17; (1940) 63 CLR 619 . (at p297)

3. The result is that the presence of consideration is not to be treated for the purpose of duty as inconsistent with the transaction embodied in the instrument being a gift. It may be a gift although the instrument is made upon a good or valuable consideration unless it be a consideration which is not only bona fide but is adequate and pecuniary. "Still, the dominant words of the schedule suggest an instrument whereby some benefaction is intended and conferred". "It cannot be pretended that this conclusion is satisfactory, for it affords no clear rule and requires the consideration of the facts of each particular case", per Starke J. (1940) 63 CLR, at p 641 . (at p297)

4. But all this relates to the prima-facie contrariety between the notion of a gift and of a valuable consideration. It has no relation to the word "settlement". There is no logical or legal contradiction between the conception of a settlement and the existence of good or valuable consideration for the transaction. Cf. per Latham C.J. (1940) 63 CLR, at pp 631, 632 . At a stage in the present case reliance appears to have been placed upon the authorities establishing that some element of benefaction must exist before a transaction can fall within the category of a gift under par. IX. and the instrument embodying it be for that reason liable to stamp duty. But in the Supreme Court Sholl J., before whom the case stated was argued, negatived the idea that some element of benefaction is necessary before an instrument can be a settlement and dutiable as such under par. IX. Of the correctness of this view I think that there can be no doubt. (at p298)

5. Another matter depending wholly on the meaning of the provision was raised. It was contended that a consideration might be pecuniary although it was neither expressed nor satisfied in money or the equivalent of money. Such an interpretation of the words "pecuniary consideration" is not admissible. Pecuniary consideration means a consideration consisting of or having relation to money. (at p298)

6. The appeal, in my opinion, depends on the question whether the indenture is an instrument whereby property is settled or agreed to be settled and, if that is decided against the appellant, upon the further questions whether duty should be charged on the whole of the property with which the indenture deals or on a given part of it only and how the duty is to be calculated. (at p298)

7. The indenture is expressed to be made between the widow of the testator of the first part, his four children of the second part, and the trustee of his will of the third part. It recites the effect of the provisions of the will in favour of the widow and children, the death of the testator on 26th April 1930 and the grant of probate. The recitals then proceed - "And whereas the children are desirous of having a present distribution of their respective presumptive interests in the said residuary estate. And whereas doubts have arisen whether on the true construction of the testator's Will such distribution could lawfully be presently made. And whereas the widow and children are all of age and in order to avoid litigation delay and expense and to facilitate the desire of the children for a present distribution on account of their said interests in the said residuary estate have agreed that such residuary estate should be administered in manner hereinafter appearing to which at their request the Trustee has agreed upon having such release and indemnity as are hereinafter contained".

8. It is now necessary to turn to the will before stating the manner in which the operative part of the indenture affected the testamentary dispositions made by the testator. In the events which happened the residuary estate was devised and bequeathed upon the following trusts: as to one-third of the income to pay it to the testator's widow during widowhood; subject thereto as to both capital and income for the children in equal shares as tenants in common. The will conferred power upon the trustee to invest any part of the trust moneys of the residuary estate in the purchase of a dwelling house for the use of the widow during widowhood and this power was exercised. The clause directed that the rates, taxes and outgoings of the dwelling should be paid out of the estate but empowered the trustee to sell it at any time the trustee thought fit. At the time of the making of the indenture the value of the assets forming the residuary estate appears to have been about 29,600 pounds, producing an annual income averaging over the prior three years about 1,034 pounds. Of this one-third, or about 345 pounds, would be payable to the widow. Of the capital about 16,720 pounds was invested in forms of personalty readily convertible into money. The remaining value of the residue was represented by realty, including the dwelling purchased for the widow. In this situation the operative part of the indenture provided that in pursuance of the agreement between the widow and children and of the premises, the trustee undertook and agreed to administer the residuary estate as if, without affecting the other provisions, it had provided that the trustee should hold the residuary estate on the trusts which it proceeded to set out. Those trusts are as to the realty to the use of the widow for life during widowhood and after her death to the children in equal shares as tenants in common, with a proviso that if in any year the amount of the net income from the realty should be less than 340 pounds the deficiency should be raised for the widow's benefit and charged on certain of the realty. Subject to this trust the remainder of the residuary estate (that is the personalty) and the income thereof "should be appropriated and distributed forthwith among the children in equal shares as tenants in common". There follows a release of the trustee from the trusts created by the will and an indemnification. It will be seen that this rearrangement accomplished more than one object. Because the widow's share of income under the will was one-third of the whole income of the estate it was difficult to appropriate to the children any specific part of the estate as representing their shares. The rearrangement removed this difficulty. In the next place the widow is given a full life estate during widowhood in the whole of the realty, including the purchased residence. None of the realty is subject to a trust for conversion and the residence is no longer subject to the power of the trustee to sell it, a power which would have meant that the proceeds fell back into residue. In the third place the widow is assured of a net income of 340 pounds per annum by a charge upon the land. In the fourth place the future interest or remainder to the children is restricted to the realty and the personalty is released from the widow's life estate. In the fifth place it is to be held upon a trust in their favour as tenants in common in equal shares for immediate appropriation and distribution among them. I am unable to see any escape from the conclusion that the instrument, effecting as it does this rearrangement of trusts is a settlement. It may be called a resettlement, but it is not because of that description any less a settlement. It takes trust property and, leaving the property vested in the trustee, it limits equitable estates in succession. It is true that the remaindermen under the old trusts held substantially the same interests. But the life tenant did not and these are fresh limitations. The personalty, which was subject to successive interests under the old trusts, is released from them, but it is made subject to a trust and an active trust. It may be that if the personalty had been free and had for the first time been subjected to a trust for distribution among the four beneficiaries and that had been done by an instrument confined to the purpose, it would not have been a settlement. But the case is quite otherwise when the instrument deals as a whole with assets held by a trustee and defines the trusts with respect to different descriptions or parts of the assets. Here the instrument deals with the whole trusts and expresses an indivisible transaction as part of which the trust of personalty is made a trust for distribution. The creation of new trusts, the inclusion of trusts to persons in succession and the restriction involved in all the trusts upon the enjoyment which would arise from full ownership mark the instrument out as a settlement. Even the trust to appropriate and distribute involves a departure from the rights of enjoyment which full and immediate ownership would give the children. It is notoriously difficult to define a settlement, but that does not mean that it is difficult to recognize one. This instrument appears to me to be well within the conception, even if the limitation of interests in succession were an indispensable attribute, which it is not. (at p300)

9. The widow and the four children combine to effect the settlement of the full interest in the residuary estate. It is true that the proprietary interest in virtue of which each joins in the collective settlement of the whole is that given to him or her by the will. But it is not that interest which is settled. It is not settled as a distinct proprietary interest: all the beneficiaries join so that there may be a resettlement of the sum of interests in the residuary estate, making up full equitable ownership. It is, I think, impossible to adopt the view for which the appellants contended that the four children really assigned their share in the realty (other than the dwelling) to the widow and that the dutiable value should be calculated on their interests so assigned treating it as a settlement by them, while the widow should be considered similarly as having assigned to them her one-third interest in the income of the remainder of the assets, and the value of the interest she so assigned should be ascertained and duty upon it calculated on the footing that she settled that only. (at p301)

10. The instrument contains and effects a transaction which cannot be split up in that way. The instrument cannot be considered a settlement upon a bona-fide adequate consideration because, assuming that the consideration consists in the passing of interests from one beneficiary to another in turn, it is not a pecuniary consideration. (at p301)

11. There is no doubt more to be said for the view that the final trust to which the instrument subjects the personalty is a severable part of the instrument and that the trust does not "settle" the personalty which therefore should not be considered part of the dutiable property. But, for reasons which already appear, I am unable to adopt this view. The instrument deals with the whole residuary estate and redefines the trusts as an indivisible legal operation. It is, of course, impossible to treat it as two "instruments", and it was not contended that it should be so treated. But in my opinion it is also impossible to treat the trusts of the personalty as a distinct disposition of property falling outside the settlement. It is part of the process of resettling the residuary estate. (at p301)

12. For these reasons I think that the judgment of Sholl J. is correct and that the appeal should be dismissed. (at p301) 

$$$

In my opinion the appeal should be allowed. I agree with the conclusion of Gavan Duffy J. that as between the respondent, the cestui que trust, and the appellants, the mortgagees, the mortgage must be regarded as a valid exercise of the executorial power of the mortgagor, but I am unable to agree with his Honour's conclusion that sec. 72 of the Transfer of Land Act 1928 gave priority to any interest of the respondent over the interest of the appellants as mortgagees.

I agree with the judgment of my brother Dixon on both questions. On the question whether the respondent can successfully impugn the validity of the mortgage, I shall add only a reference to the case of Oliff v. O'Neil[44]. In this branch of the case the question is not whether the mortgagees had notice that the respondent's interest was that of a tenant in possession of the estate with the executor's consent. It is whether they were aware that the mortgage was not for any purpose of administration. On this question I find it impossible to arrive at a conclusion adverse to the appellants.

As I have arrived at a conclusion different from that of Gavan Duffy J. on the other branch of the case, I add some observations. The proviso to sec. 72 of the Transfer of Land Act 1928 enumerates various interests to which land included in a certificate of title or a registered instrument is deemed to be subject notwithstanding that such interests respectively are not notified on the certificate or instrument. The relevant part of the proviso is as follows: "Provided always that the land which is included in any certificate of title or registered instrument shall be deemed to be subject ... where the possession is not adverse to the interest of any tenant of the land, notwithstanding the same respectively are not specially notified as encumbrances on such certificate or instrument." The section makes it unnecessary to notify any interest that is within its terms on the certificate of title or a registered instrument transferring any estate or interest in the land, as a condition of its existence and continuance. The respondent was entitled to a life estate in the land under the will, but she derived her right to the possession of the land from the executor, not from the testator. Nothing was done to vest the land in her under sec. 36 of the Administration and Probate Act 1928. Sec. 72 of the Transfer of Land Act operated to protect only such interest as she had as a tenant in possession of the land with the executor's consent. It did not operate to convert a defeasable interest into an indestructible interest. The respondent's interest was not absolute. She was let into possession by the executor of land which was part of the assets in his hands for the payment of the debts of the testator and which the executor had a statutory power to mortgage for purposes of administration. It would be inconsistent with the assumption which must be made in favour of the mortgagees that the executor's power to mortgage was exercised for purposes of administration, to say that at the time the mortgage was given the mortgagor had ceased to be an executor and held the land as trustee for the respondent. Her interest as a tenant in possession was at the time of the mortgage subject to the statutory power of the executor to mortgage the land for any purpose of administration and was liable to be set aside by the exercise of that power. It follows that the interest which the respondent sets up against the mortgagees ceased when the land was mortgaged. Sec. 72 cannot be called in aid to keep it alive after that time. Her interest as the devisee of a life estate which is derived from the will is of course to be distinguished from her possession of the land with the executor's assent. That estate is clearly subject to the interest of the appellants as mortgagees of the land.

Appeal allowed with costs. Judgment of the Supreme Court set aside except in so far as it reserves to the plaintiffs liberty to apply and directs an amendment of the name of the second plaintiff. In lieu thereof declare that the mortgage of the plaintiffs-appellants confers upon them as against the defendant-respondent Emily Cummins all the rights of a mortgagee under a first registered mortgage under the Transfer of Land Act and is paramount over the interests claimed by her under the will of Thomas Waller deceased or otherwise. Remit the cause to the Supreme Court to be dealt with consistently with this declaration. Respondent Cummins to pay appellants' costs of action in Supreme Court from 23rd July 1936. Appellants and respondent Cummins to abide their own costs of the summons reserved by the order of 23rd July 1936.

The view I take of this case may be thought too simple but to me facts and a due application of the material rules of law. I say rules of law, although the case arises under s. 19 (1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1923-1953 (N.S.W.) which corresponds with s. 14 (1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 (Imp.). In doing so I may not use the most appropriate expression because perhaps the rigidity of the text, apparently an unavoidable feature of codification, and the consequent inadmissibility of any resort to principle may account in part for the difficulty to which the case has given rise. (at p268)

2. The appeal comes to this Court from an order of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (Owen and Herron JJ., Hardie J. dissenting) (1958) 3 LGRA 236 allowing an appeal from a judgment given by Ferguson J. at the trial of an action without a jury. Ferguson J. entered judgment for the defendant but that judgment was reversed upon one count in the declaration. The action was brought by the purchaser of a tractor against the vendor and the count alleged an implied warranty of fitness for the purpose for which the tractor was purchased and claimed damages for breach of the warranty. It is the only count with which it is necessary for me to deal. Ferguson J. held that the count was not made out because it was not shown that the buyer relied upon the skill and judgment of the seller. The majority of the Full Court were of the contrary opinion. (at p269)

3. The story of the tractor can be told briefly. In the early part of the year 1951 the Council of the Shire of Ashford, which is the plaintiff in the action and the respondent in this Court, found itself in need, more or less immediate need, of an additional piece of road-making equipment. What it needed was a crawler tractor fitted with a "dozer blade". It possessed a power control unit and did not want another for the machine. But it needed a tractor with a capacity to draw a scraper scoop or the like. At that time any of the well-known American or English machines of the kind the council required was unprocurable, at all events it could not be obtained without waiting a long time. But an agent for motor vehicles and machinery at Inverell brought under the notice of the shire clerk and president the fact that there was or might be available a tractor made in Italy and called by the name Breda. The agent represented the Dependable Motors Pty. Ltd., a company which is the defendant in the action and the appellant in this Court. At its premises in Sydney the defendant company had one or two Breda tractors on hand, Model 70D. They had been obtained for "distribution" from another company which doubtless was the importer. The tractors were in fact produced by the Societa Italiano Ernesto Breda. When complaints reached the Italian Societa later about the failure of the performance of the tractor as a road implement, they wrote that it was supplied by them for agriculture and not for industrial use. In fact there was a brass plate upon the tractor bearing the words "Trattori Agricoli" and it is now common ground that it was not fit for the heavy work of road making and maintenance, the only purpose for which the council wanted it. When the agent at Inverell told the shire clerk of the Breda tractors at Dependable Motors Pty. Ltd. he gave him a pamphlet depicting them and some further particulars. The shire clerk discussed the matter with the president and over the telephone with some councillors. It was a country shire, the councillors lived in different places many miles apart and notwithstanding that the purchase of so costly a machine can scarcely have been regarded as a small matter, that was the way of doing business. With their approval and perhaps at the instance of the president the clerk took the next step. Very shortly before this time the council had appointed a new engineer. He was to take up his duties on 2nd April 1951, that is in about three weeks time. He was the engineer of another shire and the time of his service with that municipality had not quite come to an end, but he had gone down to Sydney to attend the Annual Conference of Local Government Engineers. The step which the shire clerk took was to telephone to the engineer designate in Sydney and request him to go to the showrooms or shop of Dependable Motors Pty. Ltd., ask for a Mr. Corney, inspect the tractor and see if it was suitable for the work required. The engineer designate followed his instructions and then telephoned to the shire clerk. The visit to Dependable Motors Pty. Ltd. seems to have been on Monday, 12th March 1951, and the clerk says that the engineer telephoned back within a day or two of his message. The witnesses were deposing to conversations which took place nearly six years before and it would not be surprising if they gave only a condensed account of what was said. At all events the account of the clerk of the telephone report was simply that the engineer told him that he had inspected the tractor and that it seemed to him to have plenty of horse-power and was big enough for the work required. On this being communicated, doubtless by telephone, to the president and the councillors, the clerk was instructed to purchase the tractor. The shire clerk on 16th March 1951 sent an order, on the shire council's order form, to Dependable Motors Pty. Ltd. in Sydney; the order was expressed to be for "1 Breda 70D Crawler Tractor equipped with cable dozer but not a P.C.U. as quoted by your Inverell agent" naming him. P.C.U. stands for power control unit. The fact that the order was from a shire council and that the tractor was to be equipped with a cable dozer necessarily meant that the implement was bought for road work. Indeed Mr. Corney in his evidence said that there could be only one purpose for the dozer blade and that was road work and the fact that a shire council wanted the tractor for its operation meant that it was going to be used for road construction and the like. Moreover he said that his company had advertised the Breda 70D tractor as suitable for road work and tried to sell that model for road work. (at p271)

4. In due course the machine was invoiced and delivered to the council. The invoice described the implement and gave the price under two headings, first a "New Breda Crawler Tractor model 70D Serial No. 4942; 5,915 pounds": second a "cable-controlled trail-builder fitted to tractor: 830 pounds". The invoice stated that a P.C.U. was not supplied and the net price ex store was 6,745 pounds. For this price a cheque was sent by the council. The invoice, as will be seen, showed that a tractor equipped for road work was the subject of the sale. There is no doubt that the machine was not fit for that work. This was shown by the hard experience of the council in its attempts to employ the tractor for the purpose and the fact is no longer denied by the defendant. (at p271)

5. I would imagine that if the liability of the seller in such circumstances were governed by the common law and not by the statutory formula a simple finding that the vendor sold the implement for the purpose of road making by the vendee would spell a warranty of fitness for that purpose. At all events that is what Best C.J. thought. "If a man sells an article, he thereby warrants that it is merchantable - that it is fit for some purpose . . . . If he sells it for a particular purpose, he thereby warrants it fit for that purpose": Jones v. Bright [1829] EngR 487; (1829) 5 Bing 533, at p 544 [1829] EngR 487; (130 ER 1167, at p 1172) . Best C.J. stated the position simply. While the rule was affirmed without much loss of its simplicity of form, the underlying principle was expounded by Brett L.J. for the Court of Appeal in Randall v. Newson (1877) 2 QBD 102 . With perhaps more flexibility than the code allows, the law, so it appeared, sought the intention of the parties by determining the real commercial or business description of the thing forming the subject-matter of the transaction. "If the subject-matter be an article or commodity to be used for a particular purpose the thing offered or delivered must answer that description, that is to say, it must be that article or commodity, and reasonably fit for the particular purpose." (1877) 2 QBD, at p 109 . It is, of course, a matter of fact but I should say with some confidence that the true sense of the transaction as it appears from the facts stated so far was the sale of a tractor for the particular purpose of road work, that is, road making and maintenance. It was never necessary that the purpose should, so to speak, be written out large. It was enough if the intention clearly appeared from the circumstances and the spoken and written word, the contract not being wholly reduced to writing. But the provision of the Sale of Goods Act sets a criterion which is not necessarily the same, though it may be more exact in its application, and it is that criterion which must govern the matter. It requires that the buyer shall expressly or by implication make known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required so as to show that the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment. It is said that the buyer, the shire council, never did this; and it was upon that ground that judgment passed for the defendant Dependable Motors Pty. Ltd. at the trial before Ferguson J. There is, of course, an additional condition prescribed by the provision of the Sale of Goods Act, viz. the goods must be of a description which it is in the course of the seller's business to supply, but that condition was undeniably fulfilled. (at p272)

6. The reason why it was held that the first condition was not satisfied was not because the particular purpose was not made known to the seller, Dependable Motors Pty. Ltd., but because it was not made known so as to show that the buyer, the shire council, relied on the company's skill or judgment and perhaps also because in any case it was not the shire council that so made it known. (at p272)

7. Now there is very strong ground in the evidence of the engineer designate for concluding that at the interview on 12th March 1951 between the engineer designate of the shire council and Mr. Corney at the premises in Sydney of Dependable Motors Pty. Ltd., the engineer did make known to that gentleman the particular purpose for which the implement was required by the shire council and made it known so as to show that reliance was being placed on his skill and judgment. Mr. Corney was managing director of the company and there could be no question of his authority to speak for it on such a subject. But what is said is that when he spoke he did not speak to an agent of the shire council authorised in that behalf. Any reliance on his skill and judgment or on that of his company was the reliance of the engineer designate not of the shire council; the president and councillors had obtained what guidance they needed from the shire clerk's report of what the engineer designate had said to the latter over the telephone, not from Mr. Corney. (at p272)

8. This view of the matter I am unable to accept. It appears to me to depend upon distinctions between the capacities of the persons by whom the corporation's part of the business was transacted which reflects nothing that the provision of the Sale of Goods Act requires, still less the law of agency. In effect it means a transfer of the responsibility for every step in the transaction to the president and councillors and regards them as the persons who must exhibit a reliance, which is their own personally, upon the skill and judgment of Mr. Corney or of his company. Or if it does not do that it treats the engineer designate as a stranger to the corporation who did not represent it in his discussion with Mr. Corney and could not speak on its behalf. In neither of these views can I agree. After all, when we speak of the Council of the Shire of Ashford and so name the plaintiff in the proceedings we are naming the corporate body not the president and the councillors. If there were no provisions in the Local Government Act 1919 (N.S.W.) such as s. 516 such a transaction as that in question might go through and none of the latter might ever be called upon even to give their assent to it. The corporation must act by servants and agents. In any transaction carried through by a corporation different steps may be taken by different persons on its behalf and it often may be that it is only by combining their various actions that legal completeness can be given to a transaction. I see no reason why this should not be so in the negotiation of a contract for the purchase of goods and why the process should not be thus accomplished of making it known to the seller that the corporation as buyer relies by its servants and agents upon the seller's skill and judgment. As to the capacity in which the engineer designate went to Dependable Motors Pty. Ltd. to inspect the tractor and to see Mr. Corney, I can feel little doubt notwithstanding the brevity of the account given of his instructions from the shire clerk over the telephone. He was an engineer about to take over the office for the shire council involving the responsibility for road construction and maintenance. If he had assumed office he would be the natural, the inevitable, person to go into the proposal to purchase a tractor, to discuss the technical or engineering aspects with the suppliers, to inspect the implement and to advise the shire council. That is how he understood his commission, if one is to judge by what he did, and I should infer that that is what he was meant to do. According to his own account when he saw Mr. Corney on 12th March 1951, he gave him his name "and so on" and said that he was there on behalf of the Ashford shire council. Mr. Corney says that he introduced himself as the shire engineer. The evidence of the engineer is that he inspected the tractor with Mr. Corney and that they had a long discussion about its various features including its weight and horse-power. Then the engineer's evidence proceeded: "He said, 'It is a very reputable firm. It is a very big firm engaged in the manufacture of locomotives as well as tractors. It is quite an outstanding firm in Italy', and he added that there was no doubt about the quality of the machine or the quality of the tracks. Then I said to him, 'Will this machine do the work we expect it to do?' and he replied, 'What do you expect it to do?' I said, 'It will be engaged entirely on road construction work', and he said, 'What does that entail?' I said, 'Clearing, some clearing and a lot of dozer work, and quite a lot of scoop work. The council had already purchased a 6-8 yard scraper scoop'. . . . I then said, 'this tractor will be required to haul that scoop. Will it be capable of doing that?' and he replied 'Yes. That is the type of work the tractor is built for. It is just the type of work to suit it.' I then said, 'The Council does require a dozer blade', and he said, 'Yes. I know something about that. They want the dozer blade to fit on to the tractor'. I then said, 'That is right. Do you know a reputable firm which is capable of building a good blade?'" Mr. Corney named the firm he would employ and the conversation ended with a question from the engineer about the blade being capable of doing the work and being suitable for the machine, to which Mr. Corney gave an affirmative reply, adding that he would see that a proper sized blade was fitted to the machine. (at p274)

9. Evidence as to the engineer's beliefs, as to the result upon his mind of this conversation, was shut out but there can be no doubt that his reliance on Mr. Corney's skill and judgment was sufficient to satisfy the standard set by the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act. There is no point in discussing in this case the precise degree of actual reliance required, how it must be exhibited and what presumptively shows it. As Hardie J. pointed out in his dissenting judgment (1958) 3 LGRA, at p 248 a divergence of view about some matters affecting the application of the provision may be found in utterances of high authority; among such matters are those I have mentioned. Cf. the cases cited by his Honour, Manchester Liners Ltd. v. Rea Ltd. (1922) 2 AC 74 ; the extract from the opinion of Lord Summer in Medway Oil and Storage Co. Ltd. v. Silica Gel Corporation, reported (1928) 33 Com Cas 195, at p 196 and set out (1933) 50 CLR, at p 415 ; and Cammell Laird & Co. v. The Manganese Bronze and Brass Co. Ltd. (1934) AC 402 . There is no point here in discussing these matters because so far as the engineer designate is concerned plainly his evidence means that he exhibited an ample reliance on the seller's skilll and judgment and in respect of the very matters which in the result involved the unfitness of the implement. A real difficulty arises because Mr. Corney in his evidence denied that the critical statement was actually made that the implement was to be used for road making or that the question was asked whether it would do the work. He says that he knew that that was the purpose for which the shire council wanted the tractor and the dozer blade, it was the only purpose for wanting an implement so equipped, and he says that he would not have hesitated to tell the engineer that the implement was suitable for the shire council's roadwork had he been asked, but he denies that he was asked. Unfortunately in his judgment Ferguson J. does not explicitly resolve the conflict. His Honour, referring to the evidence that Mr. Corney was informed of the purpose for which the tractor was required, said: "Mr. Corney says he was not specifically so informed; but as it was a shire council that required it - and with a dozer blade attached - he knew it would be used for Council operations, including road work. On this evidence, and from the terms of the order subsequently sent, I am satisfied that the plaintiff, if not expressly, at least impliedly made known to the defendant the particular purpose for which the tractor was required." Any course is to be preferred to sending this case down for further hearing after all the years that have passed since the transaction took place and in the Supreme Court Herron J. after a full examination of the record felt that he was justified in going beyond the precise statement of Ferguson J. and carrying the findings of fact to their full conclusion. It is indeed difficult to believe that in the interview in question one way or another the purpose for which the implement was required was not made known to Mr. Corney so as to show that reliance was being placed on his skill or judgment or that of Dependable Motors Pty. Ltd. speaking through him. In the circumstances I think that the appeal should be decided on this basis of fact. (at p275)

10. The case seems to me on that footing to come down not so much to a question of the effect of s. 19 (1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1923- 1953 (N.S.W.) as to one's conception of how a corporation or any other business organisation may proceed through its servants and agents in negotiating an important purchase. True the engineer designate was only proleptically the servant of the corporation. But that did not prevent his being its agent for the purpose of dealing with the fitness of the implement and moreover, he held himself out as the engineer. There was no reason why he should distinguish, for the purpose in hand, between his then position as a designate and his position when three weeks later he should enter upon his duties. Nor does there seem to me to be any reason to trouble about the scope of his authority. Of course he had no authority to conclude a contract. But for purposes of ascertaining the suitability of the implement for the shire council's purposes he "represented" the corporation on that occasion. Doubtless his instructions, as deposed to by the shire clerk, may read as compendious to the point of casualness. It is not however the custom of the country to expatiate upon what is obviously involved in the competent performance of a commission, particularly when it is entrusted to a man who is on his own ground in executing it. He himself was not asked about his instructions. But in any case he performed his mission in the manner he described and all he did has been adopted by the corporation. (at p276)

11. In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. (at p276)

This is a reference under s. 18 of the Judiciary Act

2. The question discussed in the argument on the reference was whether s. 233B (1) (ca) of the Customs Act 1901-1971 is a valid law of the Commonwealth. The discussion centred upon the words "which are reasonably suspected of having been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act". (at p309)

3. Section 51 (i.) of the Constitution is the source of the Commonwealth power to prohibit the importation of goods into Australia. The words "prohibited imports" in s. 233B mean narcotic goods the importation of which into Australia is prohibited under s. 50 of the Act. The description "prohibited imports" is to be found in s. 51 of the Act. (at p309)

4. It is a valid exercise of the legislative power incidental to the power granted by s. 51 (i.) to make the possession in Australia without reasonable excuse of narcotic goods an offence punishable under the Customs Act 1901-1971. That clearly is an appropriate means of excluding narcotic substances, as defined in s. 4 of the Customs Act 1901-1971 (as amended by the Customs Act (No. 2) 1971), from the channels of trade and commerce with other countries. (at p309)

5. Section 233B (1) (c) differs from s. 233B (1) (ca) only in that the offence under the former provision is to be in possession of narcotic goods in the category of prohibited imports, "which have been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act". I think that there is no objection to the constitutionality of that provision. Did the parliament overstep the limit of power granted by s. 51 (i.) of the Constitution by inserting par. (ca) in s. 233B (1), having regard to the difference between the wording of that paragraph and that of par. (c)? It seems to me that the insertion of par. (ca) in s. 233B (1) was consequential upon the wide extension of the category of narcotic substances to which s. 233B would apply after the commencement of the Customs Act (No. 2) 1971. For in the long list of narcotic substances enumerated in the VIth sch. to the Customs Act 1901-1971, inserted by s. 9 of the Customs Act (No. 2) 1971, there may be a substance in the possession of a person for which he has no reasonable excuse and which is reasonably suspected of having been imported into Australia. Paragraph (c) would not be applicable to such a person. Paragraph (ca) would be applicable to him. I do not think that the words "which are reasonably suspected of having been imported into Australia" cause s. 233B (1) (ca) to exceed the power of the Commonwealth under s. 51 (i.) of the Constitution. This power is plenary in its quality. It enables the parliament to make a law prohibiting the importation of goods and to enact a law imposing a penalty for any infringement of the law. (at p310)

6. The words of par. (ca) provide no ground for the supposition that the application of the words "which are reasonably suspected of having been imported into Australia" are intended to apply to goods which were not in fact imported into Australia or not imported into Australia in contravention of the Act. This is evident from s. 233B (1B) - a provision inserted in the Act by s. 7 of the Customs Act (No. 2) 1971. This section also inserted par. (ca) in s. 233B (1). (at p310)

7. Dixon C.J. in giving the judgment of the Court in Burton v. Honan said [1952] HCA 30; (1952) 86 CLR 169, at p 179 :

    "These matters of incidental powers are largely questions of
    degree, but in considering them we must not lose sight of the
    fact that once the subject matter is fairly within the province of
    the Federal legislature the justice and wisdom of the provisions
    which it makes in the exercise of its powers over the subject
    matter are matters entirely for the Legislature and not for the
    Judiciary.
    In the administration of the judicial power in relation to the
    Constitution there are points at which matters of degree seem
    sometimes to bring forth arguments in relation to justice,
    fairness, morality and propriety, but those are not matters for the
    judiciary to decide upon. The reason why this appears to be so is
    simply because a reasonable connection between the law which
    is challenged and the subject of the power under which the
    legislature purported to enact it must be shown before the law
    can be sustained under the incidental power." (at p311)

8. In my opinion there is a reasonable connexion between s. 233B (1) (ca) and the subject matter of s. 51 (i.) of the Constitution which, of course, includes importation. (at p311)

9. As regards the case of Williamson v. Ah On [1926] HCA 46; (1926) 39 CLR 95 , I do not think it is necessary to rely upon the decision in that case to support the constitutionality of s. 233B (1) (ca) . (at p311)

10. I would answer the question in the case stated in the affirmative. (at p311)

$$$

The question which is raised appears to be very important in the ultimate decision of the case, so far as I can judge at the present stage, and for that reason I do not propose to pronounce a definite opinion upon it which would exclude Mr. Gibbs from raising the question again at a final stage of the proceedings. My present view is that the evidence is admissible. (at p4)

2. The question arises in this way. An officer, Mr. Tobin, armed with a customary authority, interviewed one of the respondents to this motion, Mr. Pooley, and obtained from him statements amounting to admissions, that is to say, confessional statements, by questioning him. At the beginning of the interview he handed him his authority. It does not appear whether Mr. Pooley read the authority or not, and owing to the fact that a typiste has typed across two material parts of the authority, after the words "Under the Income Tax" the words "and Social Services Contribution Act", he perhaps would have some difficulty in reading it. (at p4)

3. But at all events it says: "The bearer, Alfred Edward Tobin, whose signature appears below, being an officer under the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1951, is hereby authorised to have at all times a full and free access to all buildings, places, books, documents and other papers for any purpose of the said Act and as provided by the said Act for that purpose to make extracts from or copies of any such books, documents or papers. Any person who obstructs or hinders any officer acting in the discharge of his duty under the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1951 is guilty of an offence, for which the Act provides a penalty not less than 1 pound or more than 50 pounds". (at p4)

4. That is signed by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, and a copy of s. 263 of the Act is given under his signature. Section 232 of the Act says: "Any person who obstructs or hinders any officer acting in the discharge of his duty under this Act or the regulations shall be guilty of an offence. Penalty: Not less than One pound or more than Fifty pounds". (at p4)

5. Section 16 of the Act is directed, according to the marginal note, to the preservation of secrecy or observance of secrecy by officers. The material parts of that section are the first three sub-sections. The first of those sub-sections is concerned with the definition of "officer" for the purpose of the remaining sub-sections. (at p4)

6. That expression is made to mean "a person who is or has been appointed or employed by the Commonwealth or by a State, and who by reason of that appointment or employment, or in the course of that employment, may acquire or has acquired information respecting the affairs of any other person, disclosed or obtained under the provisions of this Act or of any previous law of the Commonwealth relating to Income Tax". (at p4)

7. The officer in the present case falls, in a general sense, within the definition: but it is necessary to state the purpose for which he interviewed the respondent Pooley. The purpose arose out of those circumstances. The commissioner proceeded against Coward for income tax and additional tax amounting to a very large sum. The commissioner recovered judgment and proceeded upon that judgment in the Bankruptcy Court, where an order for sequestration was obtained. (at p5)

8. He proved in the bankruptcy for the debt upon which he petitioned, and no other proofs were lodged. (at p5)

9. In the bankruptcy motions were launched to set aside a great number of transactions and orders were made by the Court of Bankruptcy setting them aside. From the orders so made, an appeal was brought to this Court. (at p5)

10. One of the appellants is the company, and an application was made to me sitting in Chambers for an order staying the execution of the decree, which order I made upon terms of an undertaking not to part with assets. The undertaking was given by the company, and it is for breach of that undertaking that these proceedings are brought. (at p5)

11. Mr. Tobin, the officer in question, was inquiring into transactions which were in breach of that undertaking and might be supposed, if they had taken place, to endanger in some degree the execution of the order made by the Bankruptcy Court, or its fulfilment, if they were successful. (at p5)

12. The first question that arises is whether, in prosecuting that inquiry, he was acting by reason of his employment or in the course of his employment. I am disposed to the view that he was. The result of that view is that he did acquire, or has acquired, information respecting the affairs of another person, namely, the company and possibly Mr. Pooley, in the course of his employment or by reason of his appointment. (at p5)

13. The provision then goes on to say, and uses the expression, "disclosed or obtained under the provisions of this Act or of any previous law of the Commonwealth relating to Income Tax". (at p5)

14. From the facts I have stated, it would appear that it is doubtful whether the information disclosed can be regarded as "obtained under the provisions of this Act"; that is to say, whether the information could be considered as disclosed or obtained under the provisions of the Act. (at p5)

15. On the whole, I am inclined to think that it is. A very wide meaning should be given to those words, because of the policy of s. 16(1). Having regard to the fact that the authority was produced, to the terms of s. 232 which are very wide and to the fact that the end in view, the end result so to speak, of the proceedings is the vindication of the revenue and the collection of the sums owing, I am disposed to think that the definition is sufficiently fulfilled. (at p6)

16. That being my view, it is necessary to proceed to sub-s. (2), which says: "An officer shall not either directly or indirectly, except in the performance of any duty as an officer, and either while he is, or after he ceases to be an officer, make a record of, or divulge or communicate to any person any such information so acquired by him". (at p6)

17. There is a minor point on the construction of the sub-section, which it is perhaps better to mention before proceeding to apply it; that is, whether the words "to any person" attach themselves to the word "divulge" as well as to the word "communicate". (at p6)

18. The point would be of no materiality if it were not for the doubt as to whether the Court could be considered "a person" within the meaning of the provision. It would be of no materiality except for that reason, because it could hardly be information divulged except to a person, that is to say, unless you give a restricted meaning to "person" which excludes bodies such as courts. (at p6)

19. I am inclined to think that the words "to any person" do attach themselves to the word "divulge". There is, of course, a presumption that a modifying prepositional phrase of that sort following the verb does attach itself to the last preceding verb and not to preceding verbs separated from it by an alternative. But, when the whole provision is looked at, and the use of the words "make a record of" and then of the words "any such information" is considered, together with the position the intervening words take, it seems to me more probable that the draftsman was using the expression "to any person" in relation to both the words "divulge" and "communicate". If that is so, the section probably cannot apply to courts, which would hardly be called persons. (at p6)

20. But, in any case, I think that the words "except in the performance of any duty as an officer" ought to receive a very wide interpretation. The word "duty" there is not, I think, used in a sense that is confined to a legal obligation, but really would be better represented by the word "function". The exception governs all that is incidental to the carrying out of what is commonly called "the duties of an officer's employment"; that is to say, the functions and proper actions which his employment authorizes. (at p6)

21. In a case of this description I should think that did include the making of an affidavit in this Court, in a proceeding for the ultimate obtaining of revenue, even if the word "divulge" is used in a sense which includes the giving of evidence. (at p7)

22. Sub-section (3) provides that "An officer shall not be required to produce in court" (certain documents) "or to divulge or communicate to any court any matter or thing coming under his notice in the performance of his duties as an officer, except when it is necessary to do so for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Act or of any previous law". (at p7)

23. In spite of the word "exclusion" in the passage that was read from O'Flaherty v. McBride [1920] HCA 60; (1920) 28 CLR 283, at p 288 , I think that this provision gives only a protection to the officer against compulsion, and does not make inadmissible evidence which the officer is prepared to give under instructions from his superiors or the commissioner. (at p7)

24. For those reasons I am of opinion, as at present advised, that the evidence is not excluded by the provision of s. 16. (at p7)

25. But it is then said that, having regard to the manner in which the evidence was obtained, I have a discretion to exclude it, because there is some degree of unfairness, considered from the point of view of Mr. Pooley, having regard to the situation in which he was placed. He was asked to give information and was shown an authority, which on its face would lead him to suppose that he was compelled to answer, and to answer truthfully. (at p7)

26. It is not suggested that his statement was involuntary within the meaning of common law rule, and was therefore inadmissible. But it is said that the situation in which he was left was such that the Court in the exercise of its discretion should exclude the evidence. (at p7)

27. Whatever Mr. Pooley may have thought about it, I am not disposed to take that view of the unfairness of his position. He was asked reasonably simple questions about a transaction. If he thought that they were liable to incriminate him, he might have refused and stated that ground; and he might have endeavoured to reason with the officer against his persisting in placing him in the position of embarrassment under s. 232. (at p7)

28. He did not take that course, and perhaps it may be said that a layman might not be expected to argue the matter out with an officer. (at p7)

29. But I see no real reason why in the circumstances of the present case the evidence should be excluded on the exceptional grounds which apply in criminal proceedings to give the court a discretion. (at p7)

30. I need not go into the questions which were raised both in R. v. Lee [1950] HCA 25; (1950) 82 CLR 133 and in McDermott v. The King [1948] HCA 23; (1948) 76 CLR 501 , but the situation which the observations in these cases contemplate is of an entirely different order from that in which, in my opinion, the witness Pooley was placed. (at p8)

31. For those reasons, which I have stated somewhat at length, I am at present of opinion that this evidence should be admitted. I have stated my reasons at length because I am not desirous at this stage of the case completely to exclude Mr. Gibbs from canvassing the matter again if he thinks fit, and he will have the advantage of knowing what as at present is the view I take as to the admission of the affidavit evidence. The case may proceed on that basis. (at p8)

32. After certain further evidence had been tendered, his Honour adjudged the respondent Pooley guilty of contempt and made an order imposing punishment. (at p8)

33. From that decision the respondents to the application appealed to the Full Court of the High Court on various grounds, the principal ground being that the affidavit of Alfred Edward Tobin, sworn on 30th May 1952, was wrongly admitted in evidence. (at p8)

34. A.R.J. Gilmour, for the appellants. Tobin's affidavit was wrongly admitted in evidence. The Chief Justice placed reliance upon the contents of that affidavit in arriving at his conclusion against these appellants. If that evidence had not been before the Court it may be that his Honour would have arrived at a different conclusion. Tobin was not an officer within the meaning of s. 16 of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1952 at the time he obtained the information referred to in his affidavit. It was obtained by him in the course of his employment under the Act. The Chief Justice's interpretation of sub-s. (3) of s. 16 was too liberal. His interpretation was that it merely empowered the officer to withhold the evidence under objection and did not absolutely exclude him from giving that evidence. Words of that import, particularly with the penalty imposed, go further than was held to be the case in O'Flaherty v. McBride [1920] HCA 60; (1920) 28 CLR 283, at p 288 and make the information absolutely privileged and inadmissible. The word "required" should be read as "allowed" or "permitted". The words in sub-s. (3) "an officer shall not be required" are stronger than the words applying the principle expressed by Lord Wright in Rowell v. Pratt (1938) AC 101, at pp 104-106 and stronger than the words in s. 17(2) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1931 (Imp.) (21 & 22 Geo. V. c.42) there under consideration, because prohibition is directed to the court as well as to the person who would be infringing the section. In its literal sense sub-s. (3) is a direct prohibition to the court to require that that evidence be produced. In sub-s. (2) an officer is bound not to make any disclosure to any person whatsoever. Sub-section (2) is directed to an officer, prohibiting any disclosure to any person whatsoever. The prohibition applies not only to direct disclosures but also to indirect disclosures. The giving of such evidence by an officer in a court would, unless he were protected by an order of the court, be a disclosure not only to the court itself but also to all persons, members of the public in general, who may be in the court in their right of being present therein. The words "shall not be required" are directed to the court, that is, that the court is not to require the witness to divulge the information. Sub-section (2) does not refer to the court as a person. It does not refer to disclosure in court so far as the court is concerned, but disclosure in the court would be disclosure to the public generally. Sub-sections (2) and (3) together make such evidence inadmissible. The matter is beyond the stage where the officer gave the evidence for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1952. These are proceedings for contempt of court, which is not in any way related to the provisions of that Act. The matter complained of is the breach of the undertaking; not the disposal of the assets. There is not any necessary connection between these proceedings and the Bankruptcy Court or the administration in bankruptcy. A statutory provision corresponding to s. 16 was discussed in Honeychurch v. Honeychurch (1943) SASR 31 . The effect of sub-ss. (2) and (3) of s. 16 is to absolutely exclude the evidence of this officer unless it is admissible as being necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act. These proceedings are not necessarily coupled with the bankruptcy, and do not, in the particular circumstances, come within the principles of carrying into effect the provisions of the said Act. If that evidence were excluded then, it is submitted, on the reasoning of the Chief Justice as appears in his reasons for judgment, this Court could not be satisfied that his Honour, as a primary tribunal of fact, would have been prepared to make the order. The orders made by the Chief Justice should be set aside and the matter remitted for re-hearing. (at p10)

35. E. J. Moynahan, for the respondent-applicant was not called upon to argue. (at p10)

The following judgments were delivered:-

$$$

These are two appeals, heard together, from a decretal order of certain trusts invalid. In the first appeal the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals of New South Wales claims that the trusts are not wholly invalid and that that Society is entitled to the enjoyment of the trust property. In the second appeal the Benevolent Society of New South Wales claims that the trusts are not invalid but that in the events that have happened the Benevolent Society has become entitled to the trust property. (at p639)

2. The controversy arises under an indenture made on 30th September 1932 between one Robert James Douglas Sellar as settlor and the Perpetual Trustee Company (Ltd.) as trustee. The property which under the deed Sellar placed in the trustee's hands consisted of two adjoining but detached cottages at Manly and a sum of 10,000 pounds. Some account of Sellar including some references to the deed will be found in the reports of two cases decided in this Court not very long after Sellar's death, Brunker v. Perpetual Trustee Co. (Ltd.) [1937] HCA 29; (1937) 57 CLR 555 and Brunker v. Perpetual Trustee Co. (Ltd.) (No. 2) [1937] HCA 76; (1937) 59 CLR 140 . But the facts they disclose form only a background to the indenture and do not otherwise help in the decision of the present case. (at p639)

3. In September 1932 Sellar, an elderly bachelor, owned two cottages fronting Bower Street, Manly, side by side. They were then numbered 6 and 8. Sellar resided in No. 6; No. 8 was unoccupied. The land forming the site of the two cottages amounted in area to half an acre. It stretched from Bower Street to the edge of the cliffs overhanging the sea front. At the rear of one of the cottages Sellar had established a bird bath. Some of the Indian doves familiar in Sydney drank there; apparently he thought they were native doves. Other birds also drank there occasionally. He fed the birds with grain and this is said to have attracted them. The indenture with which these appeals are concerned reflects these habits of Sellar. In it may be seen an attempt to ensure that the two cottages should be kept up in perpetuity under the name of the Sellar Sanctuary for Birds, that this should be done by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and that so long as he, Sellar, lived he should remain there but in the guise of a manager, nominating his immediate successor. The general plan of the deed may be said to be to invest in the trustee the trust property, that is to say the land with the cottages and the 10,000 pounds, then to allow the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to occupy and use the cottages and land under the name The Sellar Sanctuary for Birds for the general purposes of the Society, provided the Society kept the premises in repair, paid the rates and taxes, kept the premises insured, employed the manager and staff and that the manager and staff kept the sanctuary clean and in repair, encouraged the birds, and watered and fed them. The interest of 10,000 pounds was to be paid to the Society but not applied to the costs of fulfilling these purposes but generally. On any default in performance of the conditions the Benevolent Society of New South Wales should become entitled to the trust property including the 10,000 pounds. (at p640)

4. At present the cottages are vacant and in disrepair, the so-called sanctuary is neglected, there is no manager or staff and it would seem that if the plan of the deed were effective the Benevolent Society would take. However, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals says the question whether the conditions have been performed is one of fact not now before the Court and if the question were before the Court the Society could make an answer; what answer by no means clearly appears. But the Society maintains that in any case the issue can never arise because, as it contends, the conditions to be performed are void for uncertainty or as seeking to impose duties on the Society beyond its powers to execute, so that the Society takes free of the conditions; if the conditions be part of the trusts, then it is free of them as trusts inasmuch as they are trusts for non-charitable purposes superadded to a main trust for the society's general purposes which, it says, are charitable. On the other hand the Benevolent Society in its appeal maintains that it is a simple case of a breach of a condition imposed upon a charity and thereupon a gift over to another charity, the possible remoteness of the gift over not mattering because the donees are both charities: cf. Christ's Hospital v. Grainger [1849] EngR 1000; [1849] EngR 1000; (1849) 1 Mac & G 460 (41 ER 1343) . The estate of Sellar is represented by residuary legatees (the trustees of the deed being also executors of the will) and they claim that the trusts of the deed are invalid and that the trust estate and fund results to the estate. (at p640)

5. The conclusions I have reached may be summarized as follows: [1849] EngR 1000; (1849) 1 Mac & G 460 (41 ER 1343) It appears to me that the trusts declared by deed as those upon which the trustee holds the so-called Sellar Sanctuary for Birds are for purposes which involve the occupation of the land by the Society and the performance by the Society whether by itself or the manager of the conditions and that all this forms part of the definition of the trust upon which the trustee holds. (2) For the trust to be valid I think that the purposes so involved must be all charitable and in my opinion that requirement is not fulfilled. (3) The trusts upon which the sum of 10,000 pounds is to be held are dependent upon the trusts of the so-called Sellar Sanctuary for Birds and must fail with the latter trusts. (4) The failure of these trusts involves the failure of the trust by way of gift over in favour of the Benevolent Society of New South Wales. Whatever may be the authority of In re Tyler; Tyler v. Tyler (1891) 3 Ch 252 these conclusions place the present case outside the application of anything it contains and I shall say no more about that decision. (at p641)

6. To explain the grounds for the conclusions I have stated it is necessary to describe, and to discuss to some extent, the terms of the deed. (at p641)

7. After stating the parties, namely, Sellar as settlor and the Perpetual Trustee Company as trustee, the indenture begins with a recital of a transfer of the two cottages to the trustee and of an intention to pay to the trustee the sum of 10,000 pounds. Together they are to be called the "trust fund". The recital concludes by stating that the settlor is desirous of declaring the trusts thereof in manner thereinafter appearing. Then follow eight numbered clauses in the first of which there is a mandatory direction that the trustee shall hold the lands (thereinafter called "the sanctuary") upon trusts the terms of which are of basal importance. The sanctuary is to be held upon trust to permit the same to be appropriated occupied used and enjoyed by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, New South Wales, in perpetuity under the name of The Sellar Sanctuary for Birds as and for its general purposes in conformity with the provisions of these presents but subject to the conditions thereinafter mentioned. These not very precise expressions appear to me to define the trust on which the trustee is to hold the cottages. They mean that the occupation, use, etc. which in execution of the trust the trustee is to permit is to conform with the provisions of the deed and be subject to the conditions which thereinafter are mentioned. Subject to that the occupation use etc. of the lands is to be for the general purposes of the Society. The words "general purposes" are not in themselves restrictive; their significance is really only to show that the registered company may occupy use etc. for any advantage it may obtain so long as the Society carries out the functions which the deed describes and which are confided to the Society so as to maintain the cottages and land as the Sellar Sanctuary for Birds. One can hardly regard the words "for its general purposes" as adding anything to a simple provision in favour of the Society as a corporation. But if one likes to treat that as leaving the Society with a beneficial right to occupy use etc. it is all postponed to the paramount requirement laid down by the provisions of the deed to carry on the premises as what Sellar, the settlor, described as a "Bird Sanctuary". Clause 4 directs the trustee to pay the annual income of the investments of the 10,000 pounds for its general purposes and permit the Society to use occupy enjoy and appropriate the "Sanctuary" for its general purposes "as aforesaid whilst and so long as the said Society shall observe and perform the following conditions". Then are set out a number of requirements which the Society must fulfil. It must well and sufficiently repair maintain amend and keep the said sanctuary with the appurtenances in good and substantial repair and so on. Rates and taxes must be paid. A widely defined cover of insurance must be maintained. Then it must pay or provide all costs charges expenses and outgoings of and incidental to the maintenance and management of the sanctuary and the salaries and wages of "all managers housemaids gardeners and all servants and workmen" who shall be employed in and about the sanctuary. It must do all such works and things as may in the opinion of the trustee be from time to time necessary or desirable for such purposes and in executing the trusts and powers contained in the deed. It must employ keep and maintain upon the lands a manager and all other necessary servants gardeners or workmen for the purposes aforesaid. They must be approved by the trustee and employed at a weekly salary or wage agreed upon by the trustee and the Society. The trustee or Society may terminate their engagement. All this must be done at the expense of the Society, paid otherwise than out of the income of the trust fund. It may be remarked that from an accounting point of view there cannot be much sense in this provision. The Society obtains the income of the trust fund and it makes the expenditure, but the point of the provision probably lies in a hope that the duties of the Society will be regarded as dependent upon conditions of occupation etc. rather than upon any trust imposed upon the Society. If this be so it may explain the provision but it cannot prevent the whole expression of the duties of the Society forming part of the trust upon which the trustee holds the land. The duties of the manager are set out but at the end of the catalogue there is a provision that the due performance of such duties should be one of the conditions on which the Society shall be entitled to the use occupation and enjoyment of the sanctuary and to be paid the said income. The manager is to have the control of the servants workmen and others from time to time employed and his duty is to keep the sanctuary clean and in good and habitable condition including in particular the grounds and the lawns and the fountain at present erected in the grounds. He is to permit and encourage all Australian native birds including the supposedly native doves to come and drink at the fountain at all times. He is to feed or cause to be fed all visiting birds three times a day at hours particularly prescribed for winter and summer. The expression "visiting bird" seems to mean nothing but a bird which comes within the half acre of land forming the sanctuary. The quantity of wheat, grain or seed is specified: it is fixed according to what at the then current market cost a 1 pound a week would buy. There are one or two other provisions which should be mentioned. One prohibits the Society from leasing assigning transferring demising or parting with the possession and so on of the premises without the consent in writing of the trustee. The only importance of this is that it might be construed as implying that with the consent of the trustee the Society might lease etc. the premises. What the draftsman had in mind it is difficult to say but it is impossible to suppose that there is an implied power under which the Society might terminate the whole of the obligations resting upon it by leasing the premises. There is a provision that the Society shall not have upon the premises any animals birds fish or other classes or kinds of living things not approved by the trustee. A power is conferred upon the trustee with the consent of the Society to sell the sanctuary or any parts thereof but the proceeds are to be held upon trust to purchase another property which in the opinion of the trustee is suitable for the purposes for which "the Sanctuary shall theretofore have been used by the Society in the place and stead of the Sanctuary" and the property so purchased is to be held by the trustee upon the same trusts as are declared in the deed in respect of the sanctuary. How exactly this would operate is not clear. There is a provision exonerating the trustee from enquiring whether the Society has performed the conditions and exonerating it from any loss occasioned to the Benevolent Society by reason of the Society being allowed to remain in occupation and in receipt of any moneys payable under the deed. But the exoneration does not extend to wilful neglect or default of the trustee. The provision is of little importance for present purposes but it does confirm the view that the conditions formed part of the definition of the trusts upon which the trustee holds. The gift over is expressed in cl. 5 which provides that if and so soon as the Society shall make default in complying with the stipulations and conditions hereinbefore contained or any of them the capital and income of the trust fund shall be held in trust for the Benevolent Society of New South Wales for its general purposes. To this there is a proviso excepting the neglect or omission of the manager to perform his duties if without the consent or permission of the Society and excepting the accidental neglect or omission of the Society to perform the conditions. (at p644)

8. It appears to me that if valid the effect of the foregoing provisions would be to create a trust for purposes which it is the duty of the trustee to cause to be carried out. Notwithstanding the exoneration from liability for failure without wilful default it is the trustee's duty to see that the so-called sanctuary for birds is maintained and that the purposes as defined are fulfilled. Both the Benevolent Society and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals claim that the purposes of the latter Society fall within the conception of charity for the purposes of the law governing charitable trusts. The contention is necessary to the case of the Benevolent Society because otherwise the doctrine that a gift over from one charitable purpose to another falls outside the rule against perpetuities might not apply. Each is a company incorporated under the law of New South Wales and whatever rights may be conferred upon either of the respective Societies belong to the Societies in virtue of their corporate character. It may be assumed that the doctrine of Christ's Hospital v. Grainger [1849] EngR 1000; (1849) 1 Mac & G 460 (41 ER 1343) applies to bodies incorporated under the Companies Act for purposes in fact charitable as much as it does to bodies incorporated by Royal Charter for such purposes: Royal College of Surgeons of England v. National Provincial Bank Ltd. (1952) AC 631, at pp 637, 638, 647-650, 662, 663, 666, 667 . This, however, is a question which does not arise in the view I take of the present case. It appears to me to be clear enough that the character of the so-called bird sanctuary as described in the indenture is not charitable. One may be pardoned for thinking that perhaps the benefit of the settlor and of the person to be appointed manager upon his death were not left out of account in framing the provisions of the deed. But however that may be the crude and trifling directions to provide food and water for birds afford no sufficient ground for treating the trusts of the deed as charitable. When the directions contained in the deed are looked at closely there is really no more. The high sounding description Sellar Sanctuary for Birds and the references to a manager and staff cannot be allowed to distract attention from the fact that after all the provision in favour of birds does no more than require that a relatively small area of suburban land near the sea coast shall remain accessible to birds and that there shall be food and water for them. The place, the climate and the nature of the cottage sites, makes the idea absurdly fanciful but in any event it has none of those tendencies which nowadays are demanded as a justification for treating trusts directed to the benefit of animals as valid. See In re Grove-Grady; Plowden v. Lawrence (1929) 1 Ch 557 , Re Moss (1949) 1 All ER 495 . As I have already said, the consequence is that the trusts in favour of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals cannot be sustained. It is, in my opinion, impossible to treat it as a trust in favour of the Society independently of the conditions upon which the Society takes. These conditions form clearly enough a part of the trust the execution of which through the Society is imposed upon the trustee. (at p645)

9. The difficult question remains of the position of the Benevolent Society. Can the gift over operate in its favour, the provision in favour of the bird sanctuary being void? So to construe the deed would mean that instead of the gift over being a provision to take effect only on the default of the Society it would become a substitutional provision to take effect in all conditions should the earlier provision fail. The words of cl. 5 are "if and so soon as the Society shall make default in complying with the stipulations and conditions hereinbefore contained or any of them". The provision supposes a valid obligation or quasi obligation upon the Society in the fulfilment of which the Society makes default. To accelerate, so to speak, the gift over simply because of the invalidity of the earlier gift would be to disregard the actual meaning of this expression and to imply an intention which the words do not disclose. To do this would violate the presumptive rule which governs the construction of gifts over upon a contingency and would naturally apply to a contingency consisting in a default. The presumption is that the gift over will not take effect unless the very contingency occurs: see In re Bailey; Barrett v. Hyder (1951) 1 Ch 407 and the cases there cited and discussed and Macpherson v. Maund (1937) 58 CLR 341, at pp 348-350 . The application of the prima facie rule means that the gift to the Benevolent Society cannot take effect. The result is that there has been a resulting trust in favour of the estate of Sellar. It follows that the view expressed in the decretal order of Hardie J. is correct. (at p645)

10. During the hearing of the present appeals it was noticed that the legatees, namely, Guy Fisher, Lady Hilda Madeline Britton-Jones and Matilda Gertrude Mabel Warden, although appearing before this Court upon the hearing of the appeals in pursuance of the notices of appeal, had not been sued as representing the estate. They are not mentioned in the body of the originating summons. Our order disposing of the appeals should include a provision rectifying this omission. The appeals should be dismissed with costs. (at p646)

The facts of this case could not amount to desertion if we apply the law as it has been understood and administered in Australia. The principles which have obtained in this country and which have been generally, although not uniformly, adhered to are well expounded by Cussen J. in Tulk v. Tulk[14] and Bailey v. Bailey[15], though the word "cohabitation," capable of connoting so much less, is employed once or twice in the latter judgment to express the wide and flexible conception of conjugal association which in the former judgment his Honour describes and calls the matrimonial relationship, that is "the state of things" withdrawal from which, rather than from a place, constitutes desertion according to Lord Merrivale: Pulford v. Pulford[16].

But even if we were to go further and, making desertion not only fundamentally (per Henn Collins J., Lynch v. Lynch[17]) but almost exclusively a question of intention, try the right of the petitioner-appellant to a decree for dissolution by tests derived from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Pardy v. Pardy[18], still the facts would not, in my opinion, support a finding of desertion.

In these circumstances the case cannot raise for our consideration the effect of that decision or of the decision of the Divisional Court in Thomas v. Thomas[19], which may be considered a natural, if not a logical, consequence of what was said in Pardy v. Pardy[20]. It is a matter upon which I think it is better not to express opinions by the way, but to wait until the occasion arises for giving a binding decision and then, if possible, obtain a full argument on both sides.

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

I agree. I only desire to add that if the magistrate himself did not, in exercising his discretion, take into account the grounds open to him under the Act, it would be for this Court in its turn to exercise its discretion; and in the particular circumstances of this case, having regard to the fact that, if the notice to quit was in the first instance erroneous, another notice might have been given on another ground that could have been sustained and having regard to the benefit which the tenant obtained through lapse of time, I think the Court ought to exercise its discretion against rescission. The matter remains in the hands of the magistrate, subject to reg. 64A, and is not out of his control yet. (at p490)

The controversy in this case arises from the difficulty in the interpretation of s. 22 of The Racing Regulation Amendment Act of 1930 Q.. This section introduced an innovation in the law relating to wagers. Formerly at common law wagers were not illegal and actions were brought and maintained to recover money won upon them. But in 1845, by s. 18 of 8 & 9 Vict. c. 109 Imp., betting contracts were made null and void and money won under them was not recoverable. The legality of wagering contracts was not affected, but the law was no longer available for their enforcement and the parties to them were left to pay wagers or not as their sense of honour might dictate: Read v. Anderson[1]. This section was reproduced in Queensland by The Gaming Act of 1850, 14 Vict. No. 9, s. 8. The innovation to which I have referred was made by s. 22 of The Racing Regulation Amendment Act of 1930 Q.. This in terms provides by sub-s. (1) that a licensed bookmaker, who makes a bet on a racecourse with any person, shall be deemed to have made a contract with him, on which either party may sue and be sued, and such a contract shall not be deemed to be null and void. Sub-section (4) provides that it shall be the duty of a bookmaker making a racecourse bet to "issue a stamped betting ticket or give any other satisfactory acknowledgment" of the bet to the other party, and the duty of the other party to demand and receive such a ticket or acknowledgment, and to give to the bookmaker such evidence of the bet as he may demand. Thus, the bookmaker must give and the other party must demand an acknowledgment of the bet, but the latter need not give the bookmaker evidence of it unless the bookmaker so demands. Compliance with the provisions of sub-s. (4) is not in terms made a condition of the validity or actionability of betting contracts which are made both valid and actionable by sub-s. (1); and I can see nothing in sub-s. (4) to justify an implication of intention to make such compliance a condition. A heavy penalty is imposed for a non-compliance by s. 28; but whether the purpose of sub-s. (4) is to benefit the revenue or to encourage betting at racecourses by ensuring that bookmakers at any rate shall be compelled to provide evidence to facilitate the recovery from them of their betting losses does not appear. The view has been expressed that the condition should be implied. But, to adopt the language of James L.J. in In re Sneezum; Ex parte Davis[2], "that is a provision which might perhaps be very properly made by the Legislature; but, to my mind, to insert it in this way by implication would not be to construe the Act of Parliament, but to alter it; it might be to improve it, according to the view which some persons take of the matter, but it would certainly be altering the Act of Parliament, and enlarging still further the provisions which the Legislature has thought fit to make with respect to such contracts." There being, in my opinion, nothing to prevent a racecourse bet from being proved in an action by evidence other than that provided for by sub-s. (4), it is unnecessary in the present appeal to determine exactly what is, and what is not, sufficient to satisfy the requirements of that sub-section.

There is therefore nothing to justify a disturbance of the judgment of the learned judge of first instance, and the appeal should be dismissed.

Section 160AB of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution rebate in his assessment of an amount of two shillings for every pound of interest which is included in his taxable income and which is derived from bonds, debentures, stock or other securities issued by the Government of the Commonwealth and the Government of a State and certain other bodies. There are certain exceptions, limitations and qualifications which are immaterial. (at p518)

2. The appellant Bank is a taxpayer who in the year of income derived large sums of assessable income from the sources mentioned. The sums the taxpayer so derived greatly exceeded the amount of its taxable income. The reason is, of course, that the allowable deductions from its assessable income were sufficient to reduce the taxable income to an amount considerably below the aggregate sum received from interest on Commonwealth securities. The Commissioner of Taxation in calculating the rebate declined to treat the total interest contained in the assessable income as "included" in the taxable income. He took the view that no sum could be "included" in the taxable income which exceeded the amount of the taxable income. The taxpayer claims that, on the contrary, for the purposes of calculating the rebate of two shillings, the whole of the interest included in the assessable income is to be regarded as included in the taxable income. I have stated the argument advisedly in abstract terms but perhaps figures should be given in order to make it clear by illustration. Approximately the amount of the assessable income was 6,702,000 pounds. Of that, 3,021,000 pounds consisted of interest received from Commonwealth securities. The allowable deductions amounted to 5,538,000 pounds. The taxable income was therefore approximately 1,164,000 pounds. The Commissioner calculated the rebate of two shillings in the pound, not on the sum of 3,021,000 pounds as claimed by the taxpayer, but on the net figure of 1,164,000 pounds. (at p519)

3. It appears to me that in doing so the Commissioner was demonstrably right. He was right for the simple reason that no more could be included in the taxable income than its total amount. (at p519)

4. The argument for the taxpayer, needless to say, must depend on the word "included". It is a word that in different contexts may receive different applications. I discussed the word more generally in Douglass v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1931] HCA 18; (1931) 45 CLR 95, at pp 105-107 but I stated my view of the meaning of the word in s. 160AB definitely in Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1950] HCA 15; (1950) 81 CLR 263 in the following passage: "The purpose of s. 160AB is to ensure to a taxpayer who invests in particular loans a definite rebate. The assurance is held out to him in order to induce him so to invest, because it is to the public advantage that investments of that character should be made. The purpose is in effect to say - If you make this interest from those securities a form of your income, from the tax upon that income you will obtain a rebate. The point of view both of the legislature and of the taxpayer who acted upon the assurance would more naturally be that he was to be assured of a rebate on the amount by which his income is increased by the inclusion of interest upon the specified securities. I construe s. 160AB as in effect meaning that a taxpayer is to be entitled to a rebate in his assessment of an amount of 2s. for every pound of interest by reason of the inclusion of which in his assessable income his taxable income has been increased. It will be seen that upon this meaning the rebate cannot be upon more than the taxable income which, of course, is obvious enough (1950) 81 CLR, at p 309 ". To the view thus expressed I adhere. It is true that I did not use the word "taxable" before "income" when I referred to "a rebate on the amount by which his income is increased by the inclusion". But reference could not have been understood as meaning anything but income liable to tax. Notwithstanding the argument for the taxpayer I still think that it is obvious enough that what is included in the taxable income cannot exceed the taxable income. It seems to me impossible that the words "included in the taxable income" should include the whole item of interest, however large, which was taken into account in arriving at the taxable income. "Taxable income" is used in its proper, and one may say technical, sense, in contrast to "assessable income". (at p520)

5. To say that, because an item or figure is contained in the assessable income and therefore was taken into account in arriving at the taxable income, it is "included" in the taxable income gives a meaning to the word "included" which in s. 160AB it cannot bear. (at p520)

6. The question in the case stated should be answered accordingly that the rebate to which the appellant is entitled is of an amount of two shillings for every pound of the taxable income, viz. 1,163,988 pounds. (at p520)

In this case I would first construe sub-s. (1) of s. 27 of The Fish Supply Management Acts without reference to s. 92 of the Constitution. It is an obscure sub-section and it must be borne in mind that it is penal. Does it apply to a sale of fish caught outside Queensland? Doubtless, such fish may be brought to a "market" of the Fish Board, and there released by it for wholesale or retail distribution in Queensland, according to the marketing procedure established by the Act. But is it compulsory first to bring such fish there and have them sold by the board? (at p453)

2. Sub-section (1) of s. 27 applies only to sales or purchases in a fish supply district. There is no provision in the Act stating to what market conducted by the board in a fish supply district, fish caught outside Queensland are to be brought. How, in the case of such fish, is the condition that fish are to be brought to a market, if applicable, to be applied? If it is applicable to such fish, it would seem that the Act leaves open the question as to what market they are to be brought. But arguing from s. 27B, it is apparent that the Act contemplates a more orderly scheme of marketing in the case of local fish than leaving the fishermen or the supplier free to choose the market from which any fish in his hands is to be distributed for wholesale or retail sale. Section 27B applies to "all fish intended for sale . . . landed in the seaside areas, local authority areas etc." These areas are clearly within the territorial limits of Queensland. Section 27B says that where a "depot" (another name for "market" according to s. 2) has been established by the Fish Board in a fish supply district, all such fish shall be brought to a depot described as "adjacent". Section 27B determines the market to which they are to be brought for the purposes of sub-s. (1) of s. 27. (at p453)

3. It has been stated that sub-s. (1) of s. 27 is a penal provision. I think it is not clear that the intention of the Act is to force fish from external sources, as well as locally caught fish, through the markets of the board. If sub-s. (1) of s. 27 does intend that consequence, the provision makes it a matter merely of practical necessity rather than of legal obligation. In the case, however, of locally caught fish, steps necessary to channel it through the markets of the board are, by s. 27B, made a matter of legal obligation. Why should there be this difference if the intention of sub-s. (1) of s. 27 is to penalise the sale of either category of fish if the conditions stated in the sub-section have not been observed? I think that it is necessary to proceed upon the view that the intention of the Act is not to subject fish from external sources to compulsory marketing control. This view raises no doubt of the application for example of s. 26 to such fish. (at p454)

4. Counsel for the Fish Board stated in the course of argument that the circumstances in reference to which the Act was passed, were that the supply of fish from Queensland fisheries is inadequate to meet the demand of consumers, and that unfair competitive buying of the local supply had to be suppressed. It is reasonable to say, I think, that while these circumstances might call for compulsory marketing provisions dealing with fish from local sources, they do not so cogently suggest that similar provisions should apply to fish from external sources coming into Queensland to supplement the internal food supply. Indeed they may suggest the contrary. The express provisions of the Act in my opinion evince no intention to apply sub-s. (1) of s. 27 to fish other than fish from local sources. (at p454)

5. That result is, I think, entirely consistent with the circumstances, as stated by counsel, in view of which the Act was passed. For these reasons I think that this is not a case in which it is necessary to decide any question under s. 92. I think the prosecution should fail. (at p454)

This appeal relates to the amount of damages awarded to a the action, and he complains that the damages were erroneously assessed at too low a sum. There is no other question before us. (at p648)

2. The transaction of which these proceedings are the outcome was the sale by the defendant to the plaintiff of the goodwill of the business of a fish cafe and restaurant together with certain fixtures fittings and other chattels and the stock in trade. The business was carried on in Main Street, Henley Beach, South Australia. The parties executed a memorandum of agreement dated 12th November 1949 setting out the terms of sale, and containing a schedule specifying the fixtures fittings and chattels (called the "plant") and including items of stock in trade. The agreement provided that the price of the goodwill plant and stock should be 2,200 pounds and apportioned it "as to personal goodwill the sum of 100 pounds, as to local goodwill the sum of 100 pounds, as to plant the sum of 1,750 pounds and as to stock 250 pounds". (at p649)

3. The plaintiff charged the defendant with certain fraudulent misrepresentations as to the takings and profits of the business. The action was heard by Mayo J. who found in the plaintiff's favour upon the issues of representation, falsity, fraud, materiality and inducement. As to the last his Honour said: "These representations were said by the plaintiff to be of material effect in inducing him to buy the business as a going concern. I accept that as the fact". (at p649)

4. According to an expert, whose evidence Mayo J. says he was disposed to accept, the business as a going concern was worth 856 pounds. The plaintiff in fact resold it for 900 pounds. Both the valuation and the resale included the same fittings fixtures and chattels as in the original contract. The evidence as to the amount of stock is not very distinct but the changes in the quantity of stock carried cannot have been great and certainly could not make any very considerable difference in the value of the business as a going concern. His Honour appears to have been content to accept the amount of 900 pounds as the value of the business, that is to say of all the plaintiff obtained under his purchase, and we see no reason to adopt any other figure. (at p649)

5. The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to recover the difference between this sum and the purchase money (2,200 pounds) which, by the deceit, he had been induced to pay. His damages were thus 1,300 pounds. Mayo J. however took the view that the representations touched only the value of the goodwill and left the value of the "plant" and stock unaffected. His Honour treated the provision in the contract assigning a distinct value of 200 pounds to goodwill, of 1,750 pounds to plant and chattels and of 250 pounds to stock as significant, indeed it might fairly be said as decisive. "In the present case" said the learned judge "there was no representation concerning the value of the plant and stock nor has it been demonstrated that the statements concerning takings and profits had any relation to the price paid for plant and stock. If plant and stock had a value in the business, considered as a going concern, in excess of the market value of each element considered separately and apart from the business, that accretion would seem to be added in reality as part of the goodwill. But that view is negatived here because goodwill is separately priced". Taking the view that the price, and so by consequence the value, of the plant and stock stood apart from the goodwill and that the misrepresentations related only to the latter, Mayo J. awarded to the plaintiff the amount only which, according to the contract, he had paid in respect of goodwill, viz. 200 pounds. (at p650)

6. I think that this mode of assessing the damages is erroneous and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the full difference between the purchase money he paid for the business as a going concern, including plant and stock as well as goodwill, and the value which he obtained. On the figures already given that amounts to 1,300 pounds. (at p650)

7. In an action of deceit a plaintiff is entitled to recover as damages a sum representing the prejudice or disadvantage he has suffered in consequence of his altering his position under the inducement of the fraudulent misrepresentations made by the defendant. When what he has been induced to do is to make a purchase from the defendant and part with his money to him in payment of the price, then, if the transaction stands and is not disaffirmed or rescinded, what is recoverable is "the difference between the real value of the property, and the sum which the plaintiff was induced to give for it" per Abbott L.C.J. Pearson v. Wheeler (1825) Ry & Mood 303, at p 304 (171 ER 1028, at p 1029) . As Sir James Hannen P. in Peek v. Derry (1887) 37 ChD 541, at p 594; cf [1889] UKHL 1; (1889) 14 App Cas 337 pointed out, the question is how much worse off is the plaintiff than if he had not entered into the transaction. If he had not done so he would have had the purchase money in his pocket. To ascertain his loss you must deduct from the amount he paid the real value of the thing he got. It may be objected that the point of the application of this doctrine lies in identifying "the transaction" and that what Mayo J. has done is to identify it as the purchase of the goodwill and that only. But what is meant is the transaction into which the representation induced the plaintiff to enter. The measure of damages in an action of deceit consists in the loss or expenditure incurred by the plaintiff in consequence of the inducement on which he relied diminished by the corresponding advantage in money or moneys worth obtained by him on the other side: Potts v. Miller [1940] HCA 43; (1940) 64 CLR 282, at p 297 . You look to what he has been induced to part with as the initial step. He is entitled to say that but for the fraud he would never have parted with his money: per Coleridge L.C.J., Twycross v. Grant (1877) 2 CPD 469, at p 491 . But he cannot recover the entire price he has paid unless the thing prove wholly worthless. If the thing has any appreciable value the damages must be reduced pro tanto: per Cockburn L.C.J., Twycross v. Grant (1877) 2 CPD, at p 543 . It must not be forgotten that after all deceit is an action on the case for special damage incurred in consequence of the defendant's fraudulent inducement. (at p651)

8. Now quite clearly the defendant's fraudulent inducement in the present case operated upon the entire purchase. The plaintiff may correctly say that but for the defendant's fraud he would not have bought the business or any of the component items and would not have parted with 2,200 pounds of his money or any portion of that sum. (at p651)

9. It is nothing to the point that in the contract he was content to attribute 1,750 pounds of that sum to plant and 250 pounds to stock and it is nothing to the point that the misrepresentations were not as to the value, considered as separate items, of the plant and stock. (at p651)

10. It is nothing to the point because notwithstanding that fact, what the plaintiff got was worth in all only 900 pounds and what he gave under the influence of the fraudulent inducement was 2,200 pounds. (at p651)

11. The consequence is that he is entitled to 1,300 pounds as damages. The appeal should therefore be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Supreme Court for the plaintiff should be increased from the sum of 200 pounds to the sum of 1,300 pounds. (at p651)

I agree with the order made by the learned primary judge and with his reasons for holding that the bankruptcy notice and the petition for sequestration founded thereon were invalid. No doubt substantive applications might have been made to test the validity of the bankruptcy notice and the adequacy of the solicitor's retainer to issue it but the objections to both these matters in these respects were discussed at the hearing and satisfactorily disposed of by observations from the bench.

The appeal should be dismissed.

By s. 2(2) of the Milk (Amendment) Act, 1969 (N.S.W.) the legislature expressed a clear intention that s. 28A of the Milk Act, 1931-1969 (N.S.W.) (inserted by s.2 (1) (d) of the first-named Act) is to have a retrospective operation. The Milk Act, 1931(N.S.W.) and the Milk (Amendment) Act, 1969 (N.S.W.) were repealed by s. 3 (1) of the Dairy Industry Authority Act, 1970 (N.S.W.). Section 16 (1) of that Act provides that:

    "On and from the commencement of this Act -
    . . .
    (c) all suits, actions and proceedings pending immediately
    before that commencement at the suit of the Milk Board
    shall be respectively suits, actions and proceedings
    pending at the suit of the Authority and all suits, actions
    and proceedings so pending at the suit of any person
    against the Milk Board shall be suits, actions and
    proceedings
    pending at the suit of that person against the
    Authority;
    . . .
    (g) all debts, moneys and claims, liquidated and unliquidated,
    that, immediately before that commencement, were due
    or payable by, or recoverable against, the Milk Board
    shall be debts due, moneys payable by and claims
    recoverable against the Authority;
    (h) all liquidated or unliquidated claims for which the Milk
    Board would, but for the repeals and amendments
    effected by this Act, have been liable shall be liquidated
    and unliquidated claims for which the Authority shall be
    liable;
    . . .

Provisions analogous to s. 28A were enacted by s.26 of this Act. A defence to the present action was framed under s. 28A. The question for decision is whether this defence was maintainable in view of the repeal of the Milk Act, 1931 and the Milk (Amendment) Act, 1969. The contention of the respondent is that the operation of s.28A in relation to the present action was continued by s.16 (1) (g) of the Dairy Industry Authority Act, 1970. This provision means, I think, that the claims recoverable against the Authority are only such claims as were recoverable against the Board. It would follow that if the Board had a defence under s. 28A to a claim pending immediately before the commencement of the Dairy Industry Authority Act, 1970, the defence would be available to the Authority. In my opinion the contention of the respondent is correct and the appeal should be dismissed. (at p476)

MENZIES J. Two actions were commenced in the Supreme Court of New South Wales by a dairyman with the unlikely name River Sand & Gravel Pty. Ltd. against the Milk Board claiming what were alleged to be moneys owing to the plaintiff for milk supplied to the defendant. The first action began in 1965 claiming $56,182.71; the second action began in 1968 claiming $57,231.88. The point for determination is the same in each action and it is convenient, in considering that point, to confine attention to the first action. (at p476)

2. To the claim the defendant pleaded inter alia that it was liable only for milk delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant and accepted by the defendant; that it has been duly determined that the quantity so delivered and accepted from 22nd June 1961 to 3rd December 1964 - the period over which the claim extends - was 5,063,410 lbs. and no more, and further, that certificates to this effect had been given under s.28A of the Milk Act, 1931 (N.S.W.) as amended. (at p476)

3. An application was made by the plaintiff to strike out par. 14 (e), (f) and (g) of the defendant's particulars of defence containing the allegations with regard to the making of the determination and the giving of the certificates. This application was dismissed on 8th March 1971. Subsequently another interlocutory application was made to have it determined whether the certificates referred to could be used in an action which had already been commenced when s.28A of the Milk Act became operative. It was decided that they could and that, as they provided a complete answer to the plaintiff's claim, there should be a verdict for the defendant. It is against the judgement following that verdict that this appeal has been brought asking that it should be set aside and that pars. 14(e), (f) and (g) of the particulars of defence be struck out. (at p476)

4. It is necessary, in the first place, to say something about the legislation that is in point here. (at p477)

5. The Milk Act, 1931 as amended - which I shall call "the Milk Acts" - was amended, with retrospective effect to 1st January 1932, by the Milk (Amendment) Act, 1969 (N.S.W.) after the decision of this Court in Andaloro v. Wyong Co-operative Dairy Society Ltd. [1966] HCA 61; (1966) 119 CLR 278 . The amending Act amended s.28 (2A) to read as follows:

    "(2A) (a) The Board shall pay to each dairyman, at such
    times as the Board shall think fit, an amount calculated at the
    rate of the minimum price or prices applicable to or in respect
    of the milk delivered to the Board by and accepted by the
    Board from that dairyman.
    (b) Where, in respect of any period which the Board may
    think fit to adopt, the Board has, out of the proceeds of milk
    delivered by dairymen at any particular place at which milk
    is accepted by the Board -
    (i) made the payments referred to in paragraph (a) of this
    subsection; and
    (ii) made such provision for the matters referred to in
    subsection
    two of this section (other than expenses of
    administration) as the Board deems reasonably
    appropriate
    to and in respect of the milk so delivered, the Board
    shall distribute, among such dairymen in proportion to
    the quantity of milk delivered by each of them at such
    place during such period, so much of the balance, if any,
    of such proceeds as the Board may determine to be
    available for the purpose."

It also introduced s.28A which, so far as relevant, is as follows:

    " . . .
    (2) Where, during any period, a person delivers, or from
    time to time delivers, milk at a place where the Board will
    accept milk -
    (a) the quantity of milk, or the quantity of milk of any grade,
    class or description, that is delivered to the Board by that
    person during that period at that place, and the quantity
    of milk, or the quantity of milk of any grade, class or
    description, that is accepted by the Board from that
    person during that period at that place shall be deemed
    to have been such quantity as may, in respect of that
    person, period, place and, if the case so requires, grade,
    class or description, be at any time thereafter determined
    by the Board or an officer of the Board authorised by it
    for the purpose;
    . . .
    (3) In any legal proceedings by or against the Board, a
    certificate by the Board to the effect that -
    (a) no milk;
    (b) no milk of a specified grade, class or description;
    (c) a quantity of milk; or
    (d) a quantity of milk of a specified grade, class or description,
    was, during a specified period, delivered to the Board by, and
    accepted by the Board from, a specified person at a specified
    place shall be conclusive evidence of the matters specified
    therein and the fact that the place so specified was a place at
    which the Board would, during that period, accept milk. (at p478)


6. On 1st July 1970 the Dairy Industry Authority Act, 1970 (N.S.W.) came into operation. This Act repealed the Milk Acts. By virtue of this Act the Milk Board ceased to exist and a new authority, the Dairy Industry Authority, came into being. By s.16 of this Act provision was made for a number of consequences of the substitution of the Authority for the Board. It was provided inter alia that actions pending against the Board should be actions against the Authority. It was also provided as follows:

    "16. (1) On and from the commencement of this Act -
    . . .
    (g) all debts, moneys and claims, liquidated and unliquidated,
    that, immediately before that commencement, were due
    or payable by, or recoverable against, the Milk Board
    shall be debts due, moneys payable by and claims
    recoverable against, the Authority;
    (h) all liquidated or unliquidated claims for which the Milk
    Board would, but for the repeals and amendments
    effected by this Act, have been liable shall be liquidated
    and unliquidated claims for which the Authority shall
    be liable." (at p478)


7. Section 26 of the Act superseded s.28A of the Milk Acts with the substitution of the word "Authority" for the word "Board" wherever appearing. (at p478)

8. In the Dairy Industry Authority Act, however, there is no express provision about the use, in actions against the Authority, of determinations made and certificates given under s.28A of the Milk Acts. (at p478)

9. On 19th December 1969, i.e. after the commencement of the actions with which we are concerned and while the Milk Board was still in existence, one Rex Thomas Coombes, an officer of the Board "determined" that the quantity of milk delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant and accepted by the defendant from the plaintiff at the premises of Nepean Milk Co-operative Ltd. during the relevant period was 5,063,410 lbs. On the same day he signed a "certificate under s. 28A of the Milk Act, 1931 as amended" to the effect of the foregoing determination. On the same day, to pile Pelion upon Ossa, the Board itself sealed a certificate to the same effect. It is the making of these determinations and the giving of these certificates that pars. 14(e),(f) and (g) of the defendant's particulars of defence alleges. (at p478)

10. It is now possible to formulate what has to be decided upon these appeals. It is:
1. (a) Whether the determination can be used at the trial of the action ; and

    (b) if so, with what effect.
    2. (a) Whether the certificates can be used at the trial of the action ; 

and

    (b) if so, whether they are conclusive evidence in the action

of the matter specified therein. (at p479)

11. It follows, from the repeal of the Milk Acts and the constitution of the Authority by and under the Dairy Industry Authority Act, 1970 and the provisions of s. 16 thereof, that the plaintiff can recover from the Authority such claims, and such claims only, that were recoverable against the Board immediately before 1st July 1970. Furthermore, the plaintiff's actions against the Board became, on 1st July 1970, actions against the Authority. (at p479)

12. By the pleading of the determination made by Coombes, the Authority is now asserting that, since the Board, on 30th June 1970, was only liable to pay the plaintiff for the quantity of milk specified therein, viz. 5,063,410 lbs., notwithstanding that the plaintiff may have delivered more milk to the Board's agent, Nepean Milk Co-operative Ltd., the Authority is not liable for any amount beyond the price of that quantity. How that amount is to be calculated is left to conjecture, for the determination is merely as to the total quantity delivered from time to time over three and a half years during which period the price, no doubt, varied. Furthermore, the determination is silent about the grade, class or description of the milk to which it relates. These omissions may make the determination worthless as a basis for the calculation of what amount the plaintiff is entitled to receive, but that is hardly the point here. The Authority wants to use the determination to establish that, in the action, the plaintiff is not entitled to payment in respect of any more milk than 5,063,410 lbs. (at p479)

13. As I read s. 28A (2) it makes provision for determinations of two sorts : (1) the determination of quantities of various grades delivered, and (2) the determination of quantities of various grades accepted. It is obviously contemplated that (2) may be less than (1). The determination made by Coombes on 19th December 1969 was one conglomerate determination, i.e. of the quantity of milk delivered and accepted over a period of three and a half years. It seems to me that such a determination could not establish - for the purpose of the deeming provision contained in the section - the amount of milk delivered, but it could, for that purpose, establish the amount of milk accepted. Obviously all milk that was accepted had been delivered. Here then there is a determination of the amount of milk accepted by the Board at a place, during a period, from the plaintiff. Accordingly, by the authority of this section, the quantity of milk accepted by the Board from the plaintiff, at that place, during that period, "shall be deemed" to have been the quantity so determined. The problem then is what is the effect of the words "shall be deemed" in the context? Counsel for the plaintiff would limit the effect of those words to the establishment of the quantity in legal proceedings by or against the Board. Counsel for the Authority would give them effect for any purpose at all after the making of the determination, so that, for all purposes, the quantity determined to have been accepted is the quantity accepted. I find myself obliged to accept the submission of counsel for the Authority on this point. At one time I thought that the provisions of s. 28A (3) might support the contention of counsel for the plaintiff, but I have come to the conclusion that they do not and that the making of a determination cannot be regarded as simply a preliminary to the giving of a certificate. I am satisfied that a determination operates quite independently of any certificate given with regard to it. It seems to me that a determination of a quantity accepted does have the effect of establishing, for all purposes whatever, the quantity accepted, and of denying that any more, or any less, was accepted. When, therefore, reference is had to s. 28 to find out what the Board has to pay to a dairyman, it is the amount calculated at the minimum price or prices applicable to the quantity of milk so determined. I have already referred to the difficulty in making such a calculation here, but that is beside the point. What is critical here is whether the liability of the Board was, upon the making of the determination, limited to payment for the quantity determined as accepted, so that it would be irrelevant for any purpose at all to show that more or less had in fact been accepted. I have come to the conclusion, therefore, that the pleading by the Milk Board of the determination in par. 14 (e) of the particulars of defence was proper, and, by virtue of s. 16 (g) and (h), the Authority is only liable to pay for the quantity of milk accepted by the Milk Board. The Board's pleading that it did not accept any milk beyond the quantity so determined is still relevant. Accordingly, par. 14 (e) of the particulars of defence should not be struck out. (at p480)

14. The particulars of defence, pars. 14 (f) and (g), allege the giving of the certificates by Coombes and the Board respectively. These certificates would, I think, have been admissible and conclusive as to their contents in legal proceedings against the Board, but I have come to the conclusion that there is no authority in any statute for their use in an action against the Authority, as these actions now are. Section 28A (3) of the Milk Acts provides for the use of what I may call Board's certificates in legal proceedings by or against the Board ; s. 26 (3) of the Dairy Industry Authority Act provides for the use of what I may call Authority certificates in legal proceedings by or against the Authority ; neither section provides for the use of Board certificates in proceedings by or against the Authority, nor have I found any other provision having that effect. To escape from the logical consequence of this omission, counsel for the Authority sought to call in aid s. 16 (g) and (h) of the Dairy Industry Authority Act but, as I think, in vain. These provisions relate to the liabilities of the Board that pass to the Authority but they do not relate to how matters may be proved in proceedings to enforce such liabilities. Any liability of the Board to pay for milk accepted was independent of the making of a certificate. Such a certificate need not have been given ; if given it could be destroyed ; if given and retained it could be used in legal proceedings, but not otherwise. Let it be supposed that a certificate was given in error and the error was discovered and a new, corrected certificate was given. Can it be thought that the liability of the Board to pay for milk accepted would have been different before the giving of the second certificate to its liability after the giving of that certificate? It seems clear to me that certificates do not go to the creation or limitation of liability at all ; they are merely a means of proof in legal proceedings. (at p481)

15. Accordingly, as there is no statutory authority for the Authority to prove anything by a Board certificate, I consider that pars. (f) and (g) of the particulars of defence are irrelevant in the action as it now stands against the Authority and that they should be struck out. (at p481)

16. It will have been observed that, in discussing this matter, I have not referred to the judgment appealed from. The reason for this is that counsel for the Authority intimated that their argument before this Court was different from the argument which they had presented successfully in the Supreme Court. (at p481)

17. I would therefore, in each case, allow the appeal. set aside the judgment for the Authority, and strike out pars. 14 (f) and (g) of the defendant's particulars of defence. (at p481)

I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The evidence in the case is accurately and fully summed up by Barry J. in his reasons for judgment. The learned judge made a number of findings which establish the elements which Viscount Sumner said in Blackwell v. Blackwell (1929) AC, at p 334 give rise to a secret trust. From these findings Barry J. proceeded to the conclusion that the testator imposed upon the appellant certain secret trusts in favour of the respondents respectively. Under those trusts each of them is entitled to receive as from the testator's death the sum of three pounds per week out of the estate left by him to the appellant. The findings of Barry J. are as follows : The testator informed the appellant of the contents of his will before he died : he intended that as from his death the appellant should provide moneys out of the estate for the maintenance of his widow and the upkeep of her household and pay out of the estate three pounds a week to Miss Monaghan and three pounds a week to Mrs. Answerth during their respective lives : the testator communicated to the appellant that he desired her to make such provisions for his widow, Miss Monaghan and Mrs. Answerth respectively, and she assured him that she would do so : and that it was on the faith of her assurance that the testator made the appellant his sole executrix and gave her the whole of his estate, or, at least, left unrevoked the will with its absolute gift of all his property to her. I have read the evidence both oral and documentary many times and, adopting what Barry J. said about the credibility of the witnesses, I am unable to dissent from any of his findings of fact. I think that each finding is an inference which may be properly drawn from the evidence. The appellant's answer to the evidence adduced for the respondents and the documentary evidence is not precisely that the testator's gift of the estate to her is absolute. Her evidence at the trial clearly involves that the testator made the gift to her upon the faith of some arrangement about the disposal of the estate or part of it. In the case of the respondents she did not say that they were entirely excluded from the arrangement. What she said in evidence was that the testator expressly said to her that what he desired was that the appellant would, subject to her own discretion, pay three pounds a week to Miss Monaghan for life or until she married and a similar amount to Mrs. Answerth for life. The crucial issue at the trial turned out to be whether the payment of the annuities was to be subject to the appellant's discretion and in the case of Miss Monaghan only during her spinsterhood. The issue was really not whether the testator informed the appellant that he wished Miss Monaghan and Mrs. Answerth to receive these annuities out of his estate after his death for, according to the appellant's own evidence, he did so desire, but whether these payments were to be subject to her discretion. Barry J. did not believe the appellant's evidence that the testator reposed a discretion in her or said that Miss Monaghan's annuity should be paid only as long as she remained unmarried. It was argued that from the rejection of this evidence there cannot be inferred the opposite, namely, that the appellant assumed the obligation to pay these annuities. That is true, but the proof of the trusts found by Barry J. does not depend upon dealing with the appellant's evidence in that way. The proof depends upon the oral evidence adduced for the respondents (upon which Barry J. acted), the documentary evidence and the admissions made by the appellant in the course of her evidence.

This action is brought in the original jurisdiction of the High damages in pursuance of s. 11 (1) of the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1950 (Cth). It is alleged in the statement of claim (par. 22) that the Attorney-General has pursuant to s. 14 of the Act given written consent to the institution of these proceedings. His consent is a statutory condition precedent. In fact the action combines the entirely independent claims of three plaintiffs against five independent defendants. That appears to have been allowed to pass, presumably on the assumption that it is a form of procedure authorized by some of the rules contained in O. 19 in combination with O. 16, r. 1 and r. 8. Unfortunately, the substantial questions which were probably intended to be raised are brought before the Court by a demurrer to the statement of claim, that is to say in pursuance of O. 26. (at p206)

2. It is convenient to state who are the plaintiffs by reference to the name of their firm or company and not as individuals. First, there is Highway Tyre Service of Dandenong; second, Pakenham Tyre Service of Pakenham; third, H.J. King Tyre Service of Melbourne which is a business of an incorporated company, H.J. King Enterprises Pty. Ltd., incorporated in Victoria. These three bodies were, according to allegations in the statement of claim, all engaged at the material times in carrying on the business of buying, selling and dealing in motor and cycle tyres and tubes. Each is alleged to have been "a trader", an expression adopted by the statement of claim as a description of those entering into a certain agreement governing the terms of retailing tyres. (at p206)

3. The defendants consist of five companies: first, Dunlop Rubber Australia Limited which manufactured tyres etc. at factories in New South Wales and in Victoria and sold them in those States for delivery across State borders and delivered them across State borders into warehouses for subsequent sale or delivery therefrom; second, B.F. Goodrich Australia Pty. Limited which manufactured tyres etc. at a factory or factories in the State of Victoria and sold them in the State of Victoria, sometimes for delivery across State borders from its factory or warehouses as the case may be, at other times for delivery into warehouses for subsequent sale and delivery therefrom; third, The Olympic Tyre & Rubber Co. Proprietary Limited which manufactured tyres etc. at its factories situated in Queensland and in Victoria and sold them in those respective States for delivery across State borders from its factory or warehouse as the case might be; fourth, Hardie Rubber Company Pty. Limited which manufactured tyres etc. at its factories situated in New South Wales and Queensland and sold them in those respective States for delivery across State borders or from its factories or warehouses to purchasers at places in other States, or delivered them to its warehouses in other States for subsequent sale and delivery therefrom; fifth, The Goodyear Tyre & Rubber Co. (Australia) Limited which manufactured tyres at its factory situated in New South Wales and sold them in that State for delivery across the State borders from its factory and warehouses and delivered them into its warehouses in other States for subsequent sale and delivery therefrom. It was alleged by the statement of claim (although I do not think it is of importance) that by reason of the matters hereinbefore referred to, each of the defendants was at all material times engaged in trade and commerce among the States of the Commonwealth. This allegation seems to regard the practice of inter-State trade as investing a party with a status. We are, however, concerned rather with transactions which fall within the legislative power. The statement of claim goes on to allege that before 8th May 1961 the defendants and each of them entered into a contract, or at all events became members of a combination among themselves, in respect of the distribution, sale and delivery of tyres etc. manufactured as aforesaid. The provisions of the contract are then alleged, showing that it purported to govern the fixation of prices for traders and the terms on which the goods should be retailed. It was alleged that all of this was done in restraint of, or with intent to restrain, trade and commerce among the States. Then it is alleged that each of the plaintiffs was injured in his trade by reason of the acts and things aforesaid. In substance, the damage in the case of each plaintiff was said to result from inability to obtain tyres etc. at wholesale prices and his ability to obtain them only at the prices established under the agreement. The total loss for stated periods was given in the case of each plaintiff. A separate claim for the treble damages was then made in the case of each plaintiff. In the result the claim for damages is given separately for each of the three plaintiffs but in each case it is for treble damages. (at p207)

4. On the part of the defendants a separate defence was delivered for each of the five defendants. In each case the defence includes a general demurrer to the statement of claim. Of course, grounds in law for the demurrer are stated (see O. 26, r. 2) but they are expressed as if they were the only grounds available and various traverses and pleas are given in the defence and for some reason treated as part of the proceedings before us. What we have in fact, however, is a demurrer or series of five demurrers set down under O. 26, r. 8(a), before the Full Court. (at p208)

5. Section 4 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1950 provides that any person who enters into a contract, or is or continues to be a member of or engages in any combination, in relation to trade or commerce among the States - (a) in restraint of trade or with the intention to restrain trade or commerce; or (b) to the destruction or injury or with the intent to destroy or injure by means of unfair competition any Australian industry the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due regard to the interest of producers, workers and consumers, is guilty of an offence. Every contract made or entered into in contravention of the section is declared to be absolutely illegal and void. (at p208)

6. Section 11(1) provides that any person who is injured in his person or property by any other person, by reason of any act or thing done by that other person in contravention of this Part of this Act, or by reason of any act or thing done in contravention of any injunction granted under this Part of this Act, may, in the High Court, before a Justice without a jury, sue for and recover treble damages. In support of the demurrer the defendants attack the validity of these provisions. As may be supposed, the attack takes the general ground that they are outside the trade and commerce power (s. 51(i.)). It appears to me to be completely clear that s. 4(1) creating the offence is valid. The first part of s. 4(1) expresses by the words "in relation to trade or commerce" the limitation of the class of act which it prohibits. No doubt the words "in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among the States" are somewhat elastic but it must be borne in mind that the contract or combination must be in restraint of or with intent to restrain trade or commerce. Truly these words include in their natural meaning intra-State as well as inter-State commerce, but the words following "in relation to" are themselves explicitly limited to the words "trade or commerce with other countries or among the States". It therefore means on its literal construction that there must be a restraint or intention to restrain trade or commerce in the contract or combination and that the contract or combination must be in relation to inter-State or overseas trade and commerce. This, in my opinion, makes it completely clear that the law is dealing with trade and commerce with other countries and amongst the States. (at p208)

7. Turning to s. 11(1), that of course is a referential provision. Its reference is to any contravention of provisions in the Part. We may ignore the reference to the injunction for present purposes. The action for damages must be brought by a person injured by reason of any actual thing done in contravention of the Part. In this case s. 4 is picked out and it is alleged that things were done in contravention of s. 4 and that the three plaintiffs were injured. So far there is nothing constitutionally wrong or ultra vires. Nor, in my opinion, could there be any complaint on constitutional grounds if a right to recover compensation for the injury were granted. But that would be because in my opinion it is within the legislative power over trade and commerce with other countries and among the States to give a remedy for reparation in the case of private injury by violation of federal law. But the remedy given, while it may be said to include reparation, goes far beyond reparation; the remedy gives three times the amount of reparation and therefore it cannot be supported at all events in whole as a remedy compensating for injury done by the defendant's violation of federal law. The treble damages can be supported only as a means of enforcing or inducing compliance with federal law. It is in fact copied from the Sherman Act. The real cause for hesitating about s. 11(1) is that it provides for treble damages, even if this be a well known if somewhat antiquated method of inducing obedience to the law. No doubt that is why it was put in the provision of the Sherman Act. One may imagine that the method of enforcing federal law was thought to be a matter for consideration when this legislation was framed. The theory must be that a person injured might hesitate to sue if he had not the incentive of recovering three times his loss, and that the statute would be difficult to enforce if private persons were not induced to enter into legal proceedings for the purpose. On the whole I think that we should treat the inclusion of this provision as within the powers of the legislature. The main subject, suppression of restraint of trade and of monopolies, is, in my opinion, clearly within the subject of trade and commerce with other countries and among the States provided, of course, that intra-State trade is not included as a direct subject. And I think it may be said to be incidental to the purpose in view, because it provides an inducement to a private person to sue, which inducement at the same time offers a strong deterrent to the person contemplating a breach of the provision of the federal law. I am therefore of opinion that s. 11 is valid. (at p209)

8. So far as the demurrer is based upon an argument that s. 4 or s. 11 is invalid, I think it must necessarily fail. (at p209)

9. The statement of claim is open to many objections but they are of a procedural character and they were not availed of by the demurring party, even if they could have been raised before us. On the whole I think we should ignore them. They are not properly raised by general demurrer and I think we are entitled upon the argument as presented in support of the demurrer simply to overrule the demurrer. (at p210)

The evidence given at the trial of the prisoner shows that he obtained money from the person whom he was charged with defrauding and many other persons by systematic and deliberate deceit. His counsel ably argued on his behalf that although the prisoner's method of obtaining money from these persons was grossly dishonest it was not criminal. The argument proceeded upon the well-established principle that a mere promise as to future conduct or that something will be done in the future is not a pretence which, if false, is a false pretence for the purposes of the criminal law. Section 179 of the Crimes Act 1900 (N.S.W.) upon which the count was framed on which the jury convicted the prisoner, is not limited to false pretences, that is any pretence as to a present or past fact. The matter, which, in addition to a false pretence, this section expressly makes a crime, meets the argument for the prisoner that the sort of dishonesty which he practised is not a crime but only a matter for a civil remedy. If the inducement is either a false pretence, on the one hand, or partly a false pretence and partly a wilfully false promise, on the other hand, there may be an offence Section 179 says: "whosoever, by any false pretence, or partly by a false pretence and partly by a wilfully false promise, obtains from any person any property, with intent to defraud, shall be liable to penal servitude for five years." This section is different from s. 32 (1) of 6 & 7 Geo. V. c. 50: that section does not contain the words "or partly by a false pretence and partly by a wilfully false promise." A statement, however, consisting partly of a false representation of an existing fact and partly of a promise to do something in the future may be a false pretence: R. v. Speed (1882) 15 Cox CC 24 ; R. v. Bancroft (1909) 26 TLR 10; 3 Cr App R, at p 20 ; R. v. West (1858) Dears & Bell CC 575 [1858] EngR 92; (169 ER 1126) . (at p366)

2. Section 182 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides that "where, on the trial of a person for obtaining property by any false pretence, it appears that the property was obtained partly by a false pretence and partly by a wilfully false promise, such person shall not by reason thereof be entitled to acquittal." (at p366)

3. The material count of the indictment alleges that the prisoner "did falsely pretend to Percival Thomson that he . . . then (the occasion alleged) intended and was in a position to supply and deliver to the said Percival Thomson within a period then agreed upon certain goods, to wit, venetian blinds." (at p366)

4. In R. v. Sawyer (1936) VLR 1 upon which the prisoner's counsel relied, it was held that a statement of intention to do something in the future is not such a pretence as will support an indictment for obtaining property by false pretences. (at p366)

5. The indictment in the instant case, however, alleges more than a statement of intention or promise to supply and deliver the goods. It alleges that the prisoner falsely pretended that he was in a position to supply and deliver the goods. It is argued that this is nothing more than another allegation of a false promise. I do not agree with this argument. I think that, in this part of the count, what is alleged is a fraudulent misrepresentation of an existing fact, namely that the prisoner was in a position to supply and deliver the goods. (at p366)

6. In The Queen v. Gordon (1889) 23 QBD 354 the false pretence alleged was that the prisoner "was prepared to pay" the sum of 100 pounds. Coleridge C.J. said: "It appears to me that the ordinary meaning of the allegation is: 'I am now prepared to give you 100 pounds if you will sign this paper. Here is 100 pounds, and when you sign that paper, which you will do in a moment, the 100 pounds is yours.' That, apart from all question of existing state of mind, seems to me to be a false pretence of an existing fact - the existing fact stated being that the money was ready for the prosecutors on their signing the paper. That was untrue, and untrue to the knowledge of the defendant, and it is clear that the promissory note was obtained by means of it." (1889) 23 QBD, at p 359 . (at p366)

7. In the same case Wills J. said: "I find it difficult to see why an allegation as to the present existence of a state of mind may not be under some circumstances as much an allegation of an existing fact as an allegation with respect to anything else" (1889) 23 QBD, at p 360 . Wills J. also said: "I should have thought that the allegation as to A.'s intention was one of an existing fact, capable of supporting an indictment for obtaining money by false pretences. But I am very sensible that in such an inquiry there must always be a danger of confounding intention with a representation or a promise as to something future; and I am very glad that it is possible, for the reasons given by my Lord, to affirm this conviction without approaching any such debateable ground" (1889) 23 QBD, at pp 360, 361 . (at p367)

8. The meaning of the pretence in the present case that the prisoner was in a position to supply and deliver the goods is that he was able to do so because he had a business or factory or other means enabling him to do so. In R. v. Jones (1898) 1 QB 119 another case upon which the prisoner's counsel relied, it was decided that there was no evidence that the accused obtained the food and wine by false pretences. Lord Russell C.J. said: "All that the defendant did was to go into an eating house, order food and refreshment, and eat, but not pay for it; no question was put to him, and no inquiry was made from him by the prosecutor as to his means, nor was any statement made by him whether he had the means to pay. The question is whether this can be regarded as a state of things in which a jury would be justified in finding that the defendant obtained consumable articles by false pretences" (1898) 1 Ch, at p 123 . If the accused had made such a statement it would have been a fraudulent misrepresentation of an existing fact. That case does not assist the argument for the prisoner in the present case. (at p367)

9. Mr. Thomson gave the following evidence proving the representations made to him by the prisoner: - "During that month of December 1946, I read an advertisement in the newspaper, and as a result of that advertisement I rang a telephone number mentioned in the advertisement and spoke to some person. I would not be sure whether it was a man or a woman. As a result of that telephone conversation a man came to see me at my house. That would be just prior to Christmas 1946, round about the 24th December. That man was Lawrence Greene, the accused. He did not introduce himself, but he said what his business was. He said that he had come in answer to my 'phone call and he asked me how many blinds I wanted. I asked him whether he was prepared to make the blinds and he said, 'Yes,' and then I asked him what the price was and he told me 5s. a square foot. I asked him what time delivery, because his quote was 6d. a square foot dearer than anyone else, so I was curious to see what he had to offer, and he undertook that he would supply the blinds within six weeks, not counting the Christmas holiday period. Then he measured my home for two large blinds and two small blinds, and actually his quote came out at more than 5s. a square foot, because he had a minimum charge for any window that he did, which made the smaller ones dearer. The total quote he gave me for the blinds was 21 pounds 10s. He mentioned a period in which he would make delivery. He then asked for a 50 per cent deposit as a sign of good faith, to show good faith, to cover him against any expenses he may have incurred in case I reneaged. He talked of having done a great number of coffee shops and what have you in town with regard to blinds, &c. I did not ever get those blinds." The effect of these representations is correctly alleged in the count upon which the prisoner was convicted. The evidence proves that the representations alleged in the count were made. There was ample evidence entitling the jury to find that the prisoner induced Mr. Thomson to part with his money partly by a false statement that he intended to supply the blinds and by a false statement that he was able and prepared to make them. The evidence shows that the prisoner had no intention of making them and had nothing in the way of materials or tools to make them. His means and facilities for making a venetian blind were negligible. The jury was entitled to find that he made a false representation of an existing fact in saying that he was prepared to make the blinds and that the total effect of what he said to Mr. Thomson was that he had the plant and materials requisite to carrying out his order. This was a false representation of an existing fact. (at p368)

10. The count of the indictment upon which the appellant was convicted correctly alleges an offence under s. 179 of the Crimes Act and there is evidence in the case to support every element in the charge. I should refuse the application. (at p368)

Question 1. This question is in these terms: "Whether by the bonds the defendant promised the plaintiff as holder that the interest, after having been paid to him in full, would not form part of his assessable income for the purpose of Federal income tax within the meaning of the Federal Income Tax Assessment Act 1922 and the Federal Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as respectively amended or any other Income Tax Assessment Act thereafter to be enacted, although he was a resident of Australia and liable as a taxpayer within the meaning of those Acts."

In the first place, it is necessary to notice the terms of the relevant promise in the bonds to which the question relates. It is stated in each bond that the Commonwealth for value received promises to pay on 1st September 1957 to the bearer of the bond the principal sum and to pay interest on such sum at the rate of 5 per cent per annum semi-annually until the principal sum shall have been paid. It is also stated in each bond, and this is the relevant promise, that such principal sum and interest instalments will be paid in New York in gold coin of the United States of the standard weight and fineness existing on 1st September 1927, that is, the date of the issue of the bond, "without deduction for any taxes now or at any time hereafter imposed by the Commonwealth of Australia or by any taxing authority thereof or therein." By each interest coupon the Commonwealth also promised to pay the interest "without deduction for any Australian taxes present or future." The promise in the bond is not in the terms set out in the question. We are asked, as I understand the question, to determine whether the meaning of the words used in the bond is that the Commonwealth promised the bearer that pursuant to the provisions of any then existing Act, or any Act that the Commonwealth might thereafter pass, it would not levy income tax on the interest paid to any bearer of the bond and charge him with such tax.

In 1927, when the loan contract was made and the bonds were issued, there was no Commonwealth Act in force which imposed any income tax on the income derived by a taxpayer who was a resident of Australia from sources outside the country. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1922 as amended, which was then in force, provided by s. 13 that income tax should be levied and paid only upon the taxable income derived by a taxpayer from sources in Australia. The possibility of conflict between the promise in the bond regarding deductions for taxation arises because s. 13 of that Act, as amended by s. 4 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1930 (which came into force on 18th August 1930) and s. 25 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, which replaced the former principal Act, both provide that Commonwealth income tax shall be levied and paid upon the income derived by a taxpayer, who is a resident of Australia, from all sources, whether in the country or elsewhere, and there is nothing in either Act to exclude the interest which would be paid to any Australian resident holding any of those bonds. It is, of course, within the territorial limits of Commonwealth legislative power with respect to taxation to impose income tax on the income which a resident derives directly or indirectly from sources outside Australia. Compare Commissioner of Stamp Duties (N.S.W.) v. Millar[16]; Trustees Executors and Agency Co. Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation[17]; Colonial Gas Association Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation[18].

It appears that the plaintiff, an Australian resident, purchased forty-six of the bonds in the United States of America on 24th December 1929, and that the Commonwealth levied income tax on the interest paid to him under the bonds, during the five successive years beginning on 1st July 1931, by applying the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922 as amended when it was in force and afterwards the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as amended.

Nothing was deducted for tax from the interest payable to the plaintiff before actual payment. It was paid in full according to the measure stipulated by the bonds and the coupons which he held. The tax was imposed on the interest after it was paid to him. The interest was treated as part of the income, not exempt from taxation, which he derived from all sources. The decision of the question whether by taking this course the Commonwealth departed from its promise depends upon the meaning of the words "without deduction for any taxes now or at any time hereafter imposed by the Commonwealth of Australia or by any taxing authority thereof or therein." It made the promise both as the obligor of the bond and as an authority having the power of taxation.

It would be within the Commonwealth's legislative power with respect to taxation to levy tax on the interest and provide that the tax should be paid by deduction from the interest before payment. The loan was an external one and a tax on the interest payable to subscribers or other bondholders who are non-residents and have no assets in Australia, could not be recovered except by deducting the tax from the interest before payment. If the intention of the bond is that the Commonwealth promised merely that it would not collect in this manner any tax which it might impose on the interest, then the promise would afford protection against taxation of the interest only to subscribers or bondholders in the above-mentioned class, but would afford no protection to subscribers or bondholders who are residents of Australia or non-resident subscribers or bondholders with assets in this country. It should not be presumed, I think, that the Commonwealth did not contemplate that persons and corporations who were abroad and had no assets in Australia, would not take up the bonds. The promise should, I think, be construed to give as effective protection to the non-resident bondholders with assets in Australia as to the non-resident bondholders without assets in the country. Indeed, the promise would be illusory in the case of non-resident bondholders with assets in Australia if it were a promise merely to refrain from deducting tax imposed on the interest before paying the interest but not a promise to refrain from imposing any tax on the interest. In my opinion it is in accordance with the fair or natural meaning of the words of the promise, to pay without deduction for tax, to hold that the effect of the promise is not exhausted when the interest is paid to the bondholders. If the promise is not exhausted after the payment of interest, it follows that it is a promise not to impose tax on the interest at all, not merely a promise not to employ a particular manner of collecting the tax, that is, deduction before payment to the bondholders. The result is that the promise extends to protect the bond interest from taxation whether it is paid to bondholders resident or non-resident in Australia with or without assets in the country. By imposing income tax on the plaintiff's bond interest under s. 13 and the other provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922-1930 as amended in the years to which they applied, and under s. 25 and the other provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as amended in each of the remaining years, the Commonwealth subjected the interest to a deduction for tax just as really as if the amount of the tax thus levied and paid by the plaintiff on the interest had been deducted from it before the interest was paid to the plaintiff.

In my opinion the answer to the first question should be "Yes."

Question 2. This question is in these terms: "In the event of the first question being answered in the affirmative, whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant by way of indemnity or as damages the additional amounts of income tax which the plaintiff has become liable to pay or has paid by virtue of the inclusion of such interest as part of his assessable income derived during the years ended 30th June 1932 to 30th June 1942 inclusive under the provisions of the Federal Income Tax Assessment Acts 1922 and 1936 as amended."

The promise in the bonds has not, of course, the force of a constitutional guarantee: it is not capable of binding the Parliament not to impose tax upon the bond interest if it should think fit to do so. But it has become unnecessary to pursue this matter. The attitude of the Commonwealth, as I understand it, is that if it is literally inconsistent with the terms of the promise to impose taxation on the interest otherwise than by deducting the tax before payment, it would not contend that on technical grounds the plaintiff has no right to recover the taxation which he has paid in respect of the bond interest under the provisions of the Acts referred to in the second question.

In my opinion I am not precluded by the ratio decidendi of any of the cases in this Court, which were cited in argument, from reaching these conclusions.

This appeal is from a judgment of Cussen A.C.J. by which he determined a question raised in a special case stated by the parties to an action. The action is brought by the respondents, as proprietors of a registered trade mark, for infringement. The acts of infringement relied upon are unusual. The appellants, flour millers, sell flour for export. Under an agreement or arrangement with a correspondent or customer in Singapore, the appellants ship flour in bags from Melbourne to Singapore on c.i.f.e. terms. The conditions of the arrangement require that the appellants should use bags bearing an imprint of a mark said to belong to their customer in Singapore. The mark, which consists of a crowing cock within a ring containing lettering which gives the name of the Singapore merchant and describes him as sole importer, is surmounted by the appellants' name and the word Melbourne. By the special case it is stated that the merchant is registered proprietor in Singapore of the mark complained of and uses the same upon goods put upon the market there by him, but the parties do not agree that he had the sole right to use the mark there. The case then asks this question: "Assuming the brand on the bags referred to in par. 8 hereof so closely resembles the plaintiff's registered trade mark as to be calculated to deceive, has the defendant by reason of the acts aforesaid or any of them infringed the plaintiff's registered trade mark?" The acts of infringement relied upon consist of the use of the bags thus marked to enclose the flour, the transportation to the wharf of the flour in this condition in more or less closed trucks or vehicles, the handling on the wharf, the placing aboard ship and the circumstance that all this is done under an agreement or arrangement involving a sale of the flour. It is not disputed that the acts of infringement must be done within Australia. But Cussen A.C.J. was of opinion that what was done in Australia amounted to a use, within the meaning of sec. 53 of the Trade Marks Act 1905-1922, in respect of the goods in respect of which it is registered, of a mark assumed so nearly to resemble the respondents' mark as to be likely to deceive. This decision is attacked by the appellants upon the ground that in sec. 53 "use, in respect of the goods" regards use as a mark for the purpose of indicating that the goods are the goods of a particular proprietor of the mark used, by virtue of manufacture, selection, certification, dealing with, or offering for sale and that, whatever may have been done in Singapore, the mark was not used for this purpose in Australia. Upon the facts it is clear enough that the appellants did not use the mark to represent to anybody that the goods were theirs. On the contrary it would be reasonably clear to anybody who saw the mark that it was used for the purpose of indicating that a merchant in Singapore to whom they were being sent had imported the flour into that place. The wide words of sec. 53 need to be restricted in their meaning if they do no more than the appellants contend. It must be remembered that we are bound to proceed upon the assumption that the mark placed by the appellants on the bags so nearly resembles the respondents' mark as to be likely to deceive, and this must mean deceive in Australia. I have been unable to avoid some misgivings about this assumption. By dividing the question of infringement up in the way which the special case does it seems to me possible that the parties have split what may really be an indivisible issue. But, accepting fully the assumption stated in the special case, I cannot think that the language of sec. 53 should be so restricted as to exclude the acts complained of. No light appears to me to be thrown upon the expression "use, in respect of the goods" in the definition of infringement by decisions or dicta in cases relating to such provisions as those standing as secs. 16 (3), 28 and 72. What is done in Australia in the present case amounts to an application of the deceptive mark to the goods for the purpose of an ordinary transaction of trade. The fact that the appellants' purchaser in Singapore of the goods treats the mark as his own and is not intended to understand from it that the goods are those of the appellants or of the respondents does not seem to me to displace the fact that it is placed upon the goods as an identifying mark and that with it on them the goods are put into a course of trade by the appellants. There is no authority requiring a construction of sec. 53, which would restrain its meaning to the exclusion of such a use of the mark and there is a number of dicta, which were cited in the argument, opposed to such a restriction. In my opinion the judgment of Cussen A.C.J. is right and the appeal should be dismissed.

The complaints made by the plaintiff against the judgment of Dwyer C.J. fall under three heads.
1.
It was said that his Honour ought not to have treated the plaintiff's remarriage, which took place five months after the death of her first husband, Wilson, as showing that, except possibly in that interval, no actual pecuniary loss to her had ensued from his death and that the learned judge should have taken his stand as at the date of such death and considered only the probabilities then existing of the plaintiff's remarrying.

In my opinion the objection is no longer tenable. The decided cases are almost uniformly against it. I refer particularly to Williamson v. John I. Thornycroft & Co. Ltd.[12], and especially per du Parcq L.J.[13], to In re Bradberry; National Provincial Bank Ltd. v. Bradberry[14] and to the authorities discussed by Uthwatt J.[15], authorities from which his Lordship said the principle was to be drawn that where facts are available they are to be preferred to prophecies. See further the cases cited by Williams J. in Trustees Executors & Agency Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxes (Vict.)[16] and also his Honour's observations in McCathie v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation[17] and also In re North's Settled Estates; Public Trustee v. Graham[18].

It is apparent that the fact of the plaintiff's early remarriage to a husband who is as well able to provide for her as was the deceased is the substantial reason why Dwyer C.J. made no award for damages in the plaintiff's favour.
2.
But it was complained that some amount should have been assessed for the loss of financial support that the plaintiff sustained during her brief widowhood, and that his Honour's failure to allow anything for this period was to be explained by his treating her share of the insurance payable as a result of her first husband's death as involving a countervailing gain to her. This treatment of the insurance moneys was said to be due to a misapplication of principle.

In Public Trustee v. Zoanetti[19], I took occasion to state the principles which have been applied to the receipt of insurance moneys in assessing compensation under the provisions of Lord Campbell's Act in jurisdictions where legislation has not been adopted excluding such moneys from consideration, and I mentioned the relevant authorities. I shall not repeat what I then said, but I should, perhaps, add that I agree in the explanation of the matter given by Richards J. in Butler v. McLachlan[20] to which I then referred. I think I should also add that the view that the receipt of the policy moneys is or may be only an acceleration of a benefit which might have been expected at a future date, had the deceased lived, is, in my opinion, applicable to policy moneys devolving on a relative under a will or intestacy. This is true also of the further view that there should not be a double deduction, one of future premiums from the wages fund and the other of policy moneys received on death. They appear to me to be applicable to such a case because I think that there is only a distinction of degree between insurance moneys to which under the terms of the policy the relative is entitled on the deceased's death and insurance moneys payable to the deceased's estate and devolving on the relative under the deceased's will or upon the intestate distribution of his assets.

In each case, during the deceased's lifetime, the claims of the relative to enjoyment of the insurance moneys are future and expectant upon contingent events. In the first case, however, the relative's claim to future enjoyment has a foundation in legal right; in the second, it has, what may be no less real and sure, a foundation in the just and reasonable expectation of the fulfilment of moral duty on the part of the man ultimately killed. As Bankes L.J. points out in Baker v. Dalgleish Steam Shipping Co.[21], a deduction from the compensation otherwise estimated must be made on account of receipts that were reasonably expected on the deceased's death, no less than benefits to which the relative was legally entitled. But in any case, as in the result the relative does obtain the insurance moneys, it would seem that the reasoning in relation to the premiums should be the same, that is, of course, if they enter into the ascertainment of the amount that would have been available for the relative, had the deceased's life continued.

In the present case I had some doubt, which I expressed during the argument, whether the passage in the judgment of the learned judge dealing with this matter did not imply a process of assessment that could not be supported. But I do not think this doubt is well founded. At the hearing his Honour used, without objection, some annuity, mortality and other tables. These were not produced before us, but having looked again at similar tables, I can see that his Honour may well have adopted the view that in the particular circumstances of the case, including the nature of the policy, a real financial benefit accrued to the plaintiff from the falling in of the policy. We are after all dealing with a matter of fact, although one depending on general reasoning, and I do not think that the learned judge fell into any error of law in arriving at his conclusion that, having regard to her share of the policy moneys and to her remarriage, the plaintiff in fact sustained no pecuniary loss in consequence of her first husband's death.
3.
The third and last complaint against the judgment under appeal was that too small a sum had been awarded to each of the two children.

I have considered the facts affecting this question, which also is one of fact, and I have formed the opinion that his Honour's assessment is not one that an appellate court can disturb.


In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed. I hope that the Commonwealth will not ask for costs.

The question submitted by the argument in this case for the journey of the charge imposed upon a commercial goods vehicle by s. 3 (1) of The Roads (Contribution to Maintenance) Acts 1957 to 1958 (Q.). The proceeding is an appeal from a conviction before the Court of Petty Sessions at Brisbane for an offence against s. 8 (1) (e) of that statute. The defendant relied upon s. 92 of the Constitution thus bringing the case within the federal jurisdiction of the magistrate whose decision accordingly became subject to a direct appeal to this Court. (at p461)

2. The evidence to establish the offence consisted simply of admissions of fact. According to those admissions the defendant was during the months of May 1958 and as at 15th June 1958 the owner of an International motor vehicle and a trailer. On 16th May 1958 the vehicle with the trailer travelled from Dalby in Queensland to Tweed Heads in New South Wales carrying a load of grain. This has been assumed to be an operation of inter-State trade. Perhaps it was so, but if Tweed Heads formed no more than the furthest point of a detour into New South Wales in a journey from Dalby to Brisbane, the assumption may be ill-founded: see Harris v. Wagner [1959] HCA 60; (1959) 103 CLR 452 . The grain was carried for reward and the load capacity of the vehicle exceeded four tons. The Commissioner of Transport has nevertheless received no payment under the Act in respect of the vehicle and trailer for the month of May 1958. (at p461)

3. There is no doubt that the vehicle and trailer fall within the definition in the Acts of "commercial goods vehicle". Section 3 (1) provides that the owner of every commercial goods vehicle shall as provided in the Act pay to the Commissioner towards compensation for wear and tear caused thereby to public highways in Queensland a charge at the rate prescribed in the first schedule. The first schedule provides that the rate of the charge to be paid in respect of every vehicle shall be one-third of a penny per ton of (a) the tare weight of the vehicle and (b) forty per cent of the load capacity of the vehicle per mile of public highway along which the vehicle travels in Queensland. The schedule proceeds to deal with fractions in the constituents of the formula but that has no bearing upon the case. Sub-section (2) of s. 3 provides that such charge shall become due at the time of the use of any public highway by the vehicle and if not then paid shall be paid and recoverable as in the Act provided. The Act in fact provides that records of journeys must be made and must be delivered to the Commissioner before the fourteenth day of the following month and that the amount of the charge owing must then be paid: ss. 4, 5 and 8. Any amount unpaid may be recovered by the Commissioner in a court of competent jurisdiction: s. 9. (at p462)

4. In the amount of the charge and in every respect the Act closely follows the provisions of Pt. II of the Commercial Goods Vehicles Act 1955 (No. 5931) of Victoria, the validity of which was upheld in Armstrong v. State of Victoria (No. 2) [1957] HCA 55; (1957) 99 CLR 28 for reasons appearing in the report. One distinction exists in the vital provision governing the application of the proceeds of the charge. The Victorian s. 30, after directing that the moneys must be paid into a special account of the Country Roads Board Fund called the Roads Maintenance Account, provides that money to the credit of that account shall be applied only on the maintenance of public highways (including grants to municipalities for that purpose). Section 7 of the Queensland Act corresponds but the variation is found in its providing that money to the credit of the Queensland Roads Maintenance Account shall be applied to the maintenance of public highways (including grants to local authorities for that purpose) as the Minister of the Crown charged for the time being with the administration of The Main Roads Acts 1920 to 1952 shall direct. The power of direction thus reserved to the Minister is confined to the maintenance of public highways, an expression meaning streets, roads, lanes, bridges, thoroughfares or places open to or used by the public for passage with vehicles. The variation seems of little or no materiality. (at p462)

5. Since the Queensland Act imposes a road charge so closely resembling the Victorian model it is unnecessary to do more than to refer in brief terms to the features which are directly material to the valid application of the charge to the inter-State carriers of goods. The consideration that it is a mileage rate, that it is uniform over intra-State and inter-State traffic, that the basis is a proportion of the load capacity of the vehicle and its tare weight, that the proceeds of the charge are devoted to maintenance of roads and that there is no reason to suspect that it contains any element of contribution to capital construction, all this forms the prima facie ground for regarding the charge as likely to be valid in its relation to inter-State traffic. It is true that the charge applies without differentiation to each and every mile of the journey and without any regard to the nature and quality of the roads or highways traversed, but that is not inconsistent with its being a charge reasonably commensurate with its compensatory purpose. (at p463)

6. In the case of Victoria, there appeared no reason to think that the charge meant a prohibitive burden or an exaction of a contribution excessive for the purpose. In Commonwealth Freighters Pty. Ltd. v. Sneddon [1959] HCA 11; (1959) 102 CLR 280 there is a recapitulation of features of the Victorian road charge to much the same effect. After the Victorian Act had been upheld the legislature of New South Wales enacted the Road Maintenance (Contribution) Act, 1958 (N.S.W.). There was nothing on the face of the Act to explain why the legislature of that State adopted the same rate for the charge as that adopted in Victoria. (at p463)

7. When the validity of the Victorian enactment was impugned an attempt was made to establish by evidence that in fact the rate was fair and commensurate with the allowed purpose. When an attack was made on the New South Wales measure that was not done. The proofs in Armstrong's Case [1957] HCA 55; (1957) 99 CLR 28 , even if they tended to quieten doubts as to the true purpose and effect of the charge, left much to be desired. Perhaps having regard to the difficulties of statistical proof and to the equivocal lines of reasoning that had been used in the Victorian case, it was thought better in the New South Wales case simply to point to the parallels in the conditions prevailing in the two neighbouring States. Nevertheless the Court in the end upheld the validity of the Road Maintenance (Contribution) Act, 1958 (N.S.W.): Commonwealth Freighters Pty. Ltd. v. Sneddon [1959] HCA 11; (1959) 102 CLR 280 . (at p463)

8. For myself I began with a prima facie presumption that to levy a compulsory contribution to the revenue of a State is to tax and that if the tax is laid upon the carriage of goods between States it is incompatible with the freedom declared by s. 92. But I regarded the nature and character of the legislation itself, when considered with the circumstances in which it would operate, as raising a counter presumption. My conclusion was expressed thus: "When, however, a scrutiny of the measure shows that it professes to be a contribution to the maintenance of the highway, that the application of the money raised is in substance and in purpose confined to the maintenance of highways, that it is a mileage rate calculated by reference to the use made of the highway, that it is computed by reference to weight and load capacity, that it is confined to heavier traffic, that it is uniform as between intra- and inter-State traffic, that in the absence of evidence or information to the contrary it did not carry on its face any impression of harshness, excessiveness or arbitrariness or disproportionateness to what had already been upheld in the case of Victoria, then all these raise a counter presumption that the charge possesses a foundation bringing it within the doctrine explained and adopted in Armstrong's Case (1957) 99 CLR 28 by a majority of the Judges and foreshadowed in the judgments of the majority in Hughes and Vale Pty. Ltd. v. State of New South Wales (No. 2) [1955] HCA 28; (1955) 93 CLR 127 . No material before the Court weakens or overturns that counter presumption and we should act on it and uphold the validity of the application to inter-State journeys of the Road Maintenance (Contribution) Act, 1958 of New South Wales in its material provisions": Commonwealth Freighters Pty. Ltd. v. Sneddon [1959] HCA 11; (1959) 102 CLR 280, at pp 295, 296 . (at p464)

9. Now the legislature of Queensland has followed the course almost exactly taken by the legislature of New South Wales. But the analogy afforded by the relevant conditions of Queensland is remoter still from those of Victoria than were the conditions of New South Wales. Do the matters which I enumerated in the foregoing passage suffice to raise a counter presumption of enough strength to warrant us in sustaining the validity of the Queensland contribution to roads maintenance charge? The defendant maintains that we ought not to act upon such a counter presumption but in any case he also enlists the aid of statistics. He relies upon statistics given under s. 4 of ch. 19 of the Commonwealth Year Book 1958 (vol. 44) (marked as an exhibit before the magistrate). He relies upon them to show that whatever was right in the case of the upkeep of roads in the two other States must be wrong in the case of the maintenance of Queensland roads. There is no purpose in discussing in this judgment the possibility of using these statistics. They were collected and prepared for altogether different purposes. They are constructed upon bases not only inappropriate to the purpose in hand but widely differing as between different States. During the argument enough was said about it to show that the statistics could really be of little help as an indication of the excessiveness of the charge as a contribution to road maintenance. (at p465)

10. It seems a natural inference that New South Wales and Queensland adopted the same rate of contribution to road maintenance because it had been upheld. The conception which in Hughes and Vale Pty. Ltd. v. State of New South Wales (No. 2) [1955] HCA 28; (1955) 93 CLR 127, at pp 171-179, 190-195, 208-211 the majority of the Judges put forward of a road maintenance charge the imposition of which might be consistent with the freedom of the inter-State transportation of goods was certain to raise many difficulties; that was foreseen and could not be helped. But it is impossible to avoid the impression that more progress towards a satisfactory solution of the difficulties might have been made by an independent attack upon them by New South Wales and by Queensland based upon the facts and circumstances and the costs prevailing in those respective States. Nevertheless it does not follow that the legislation of Queensland is not a real attempt to impose a road maintenance charge of an amount which cannot be impugned as excessive for the purpose and is confined in all respects within the limits of the conditions which appeared to us to remove a road maintenance contribution from the category of a bare tax selecting the carriage of goods as a source of revenue to the State and so burdening commerce between the States and impairing its freedom. Apart from a separate question as to the uniformity of the charge I think the proper conclusion is that the counter presumption I have referred to should prevail. (at p465)

11. That question did not arise at the commencement of The Roads (Contribution to Maintenance) Act of 1957 (Q.) It was raised only by the passing of The State Transport Facilities Acts and Another Act Amendment Act of 1959 (Q.). One of the conditions we have laid down for the valid application of a road maintenance charge to inter-State transport is that the charge must be imposed uniformly without regard to the intra-State or inter-State character of the use of the vehicle. The reason for this may be found in the view that once a burden falls particularly upon inter-State traffic it can no longer be regarded as part of the cost of conforming with obligations necessarily and properly incidental to the description of activity or business in the given State to which all alike are exposed. Another reason is that a purpose is disclosed which must vitiate it. It is a reason to which I referred in Armstrong's Case [1957] HCA 55; (1957) 99 CLR 28 as follows: "Once however it appears that, under colour of the law, the charge is imposed not for the purpose of obtaining a proper contribution to the maintenance and upkeep of the work but for the purpose of adversely affecting the inter-State commerce, then whatever its guise it is called in question by s. 92 as an infringement of the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse among the States (1957) 99 CLR, at p 44 ". The defendant contends that the provisions of s. 8 (2) (b) and s. 13 (2) of The State Transport Facilities Acts and Another Act Amendment Act of 1959 (8 Eliz. II No. 21) produce an invasion of this rule. (at p466)

12. As is well known The State Transport Facilities Acts 1946 to 1955 (Pts. III, IV and VI) imposed a control of the commercial carriage of persons and goods upon Queensland roads and authorized the collection of fees. The use of any vehicle at any time on any road for the carriage of passengers or goods is forbidden unless the passenger or the goods as the case may be are being carried under and in accordance with the provisions of Pt. III: (s. 23). A long list of things is provided which may be done by vehicles: (s. 24). Some things in the list are defined by reference to the governmental, public, charitable or other service that is performed, some by reference to a domestic or private purpose, some by reference to the rural products carried, and some by reference to the claims to exemption of certain descriptions of commodities, e.g. firewood, fertilizers, empty bottles, newspapers, road metal and the like. Sometimes the ground is the shortness of the journey, the feeding of a railway or the lack of railway competition. (at p466)

13. The two clauses that matter here are par. 25 and par. 26 of s. 24. The former exempts any vehicle approved for use in carrying on a licensed service at any time when such vehicle is carrying passengers or goods or both passengers and goods under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licence for such service. The latter exempts any vehicle permitted under the Act to be used for any purpose at any time when such vehicle is being used for such purpose under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit. A licence is a continuing thing while it would seem that a permit should be given for an occasion or occasions. The provisions relating to licences and permits occur in Pt. IV and Pt. VI. The licence may have a period up to seven years and is subject to terms and conditions stated therein which are within the discretion of the Commissioner of Road Transport. One condition may be the payment of a licensing fee which may be calculated in one or other of a number of ways specified in the licence including by a percentage of gross revenue or a rate upon goods carried: ss. 32 (ix), 34 (1) (iii) and 35 (2). It is not necessary to state the effect of the provisions relating to permits. It is enough to refer to s. 56 which provides that the payment of a fee or fees may be made a condition of a permit and that the deposit with the Commissioner of money or a bank cheque as security for the fee may be required. (at p467)

14. If a licensee wishes to sell or otherwise to dispose of a licensed service he must give the Commissioner twenty-one days notice and comply with any directions the Commissioner may give to him: s. 42. A licence may be transferred upon the application of the licensee to a transferee under and subject to such terms and conditions as the Commissioner may determine; the Commissioner may refuse the transfer on the ground that it would not be desirable in the public interest. (at p467)

15. Section 35 deals in detail with a licensing fee and s. 59 similarly with a fee for a permit. Sub-section (2) of s. 35 gives the commissioner a discretion to fix or assess the licensing fee in various ways subject to certain limits of amount. The methods include rates per ton mile. Section 59 gives a like discretion, with a somewhat narrower choice, in the case of permits. By s. 8 of The State Transport Facilities Acts and Another Act Amendment Act of 1959 which was assented to on 10th April 1959 the following paragraph was added to sub-s. (2) of s. 35 of the Acts of 1946-1955: "Where amounts respectively of a licensing fee under this Act and of a charge under The Roads (Contribution to Maintenance) Acts 1957 to 1958 are payable in respect of any use on a road of any motor vehicle, the Commissioner may reduce that amount of licensing fee by not more than that amount of that charge." Sub-section (1) of s. 8 provides that the foregoing amendment shall be deemed to have been made on 1st February 1958, which seems to have been the date proclaimed for the commencement of The Roads (Contribution to Maintenance) Act of 1957. A similar amendment was made to s. 59 by s. 13 (2) in relation to fees for permits. That too was made, by sub-s. (1), retrospective to 1st February 1958. It does not appear whether there had been some administrative practice of allowing a deduction of the amount of the contribution to roads maintenance charge but unless that was so it is to be assumed that the full amount of the licensing fee was regularly collected and it is not easy to see how precisely the retrospective operation of the amendments worked in the case of licence fees already paid. (at p467)

16. The defendant however objects that the effect of the two amendments is to relieve all licensees and all holders of permits of the liability to pay fees to the extent to which they pay the contribution to roads maintenance charge; that means, he says, that in substance though not in form the whole of that charge is thrown on vehicles engaged in inter-State trade. These are substantially the only vehicles which do not bear the licence and permit fees under The State Transport Facilities Acts. They do not bear them because s. 92 protects inter-State traffic from Pts. III, IV and VI. See Hughes and Vale Pty. Ltd. v. State of New South Wales [1954] HCA 61; (1955) AC 241; (1954) 93 CLR 1 and Hughes and Vale v. State of Queensland [1955] HCA 29; (1955) 93 CLR 247 . There are doubtless a few other carriers who do not pay the licence or permit fees; those for example carrying firewood, fertilizers, empty bottles, newspapers, road metal and the like, those making short journeys or feeding a railway service and so on. But they are, it is said, of little moment in comparison with the carriers of goods across the border. The contention therefore is that in substance the contribution to roads maintenance charge becomes a differential impost burdening those engaged in inter-State traffic to the exclusion of the greater number of intra-State carriers. (at p468)

17. Before dealing with this argument it is perhaps as well to notice some points affecting the operation of the amendments. In the first place the language authorizes the Commissioner to reduce the amount of the licensing fee. It speaks of a licence fee and a charge payable in respect of any use on a road of any motor vehicle. That postulates two exactions in respect of the same use by the same vehicle of the same road or roads. The one exaction is the licensing fee: the other is the contribution to road maintenance charge. The amendment directs that the Commissioner may reduce the amount of the former by the amount of the latter. Probably to pursue the contemplated procedure strictly is not administratively easy and to do it retrospectively is even more difficult. It will be seen that the Commissioner is not bound to make the deduction; according to the language of the amendment he "may" do so, which presumably means that he has a discretion. However, that cannot matter if the effect is to authorize an inequality between intra-State and inter-State traffic although it is done by a provision expressed as a discretionary power. If s. 92 is viewed simply as a provision delimiting, in the sense of defining, legislative power there is then of course some difficulty in seeing how The Roads (Contribution to Maintenance) Act of 1957 could begin as a statute validly applying to inter-State traffic and then cease validly so to apply simply because another statute reduced by an equivalent amount the incidence of a charge on intra-State traffic. But what s. 92 does is not directly and in terms to define power but to protect inter-State trade, commerce and intercourse from restraints and interferences of an ascertained or ascertainable category by legislative or executive action. It appears to me to be at least theoretically possible that a law which at first lies outside the forbidden category, may be brought within the category by subsequent legislative action. Nor is it impossible to do it retrospectively provided that by the retrospective provision new enforceable rights or obligations would, but for s. 92, come into existence and they would be of a kind which would effect a change in the application of the law so that it would be of the description or category which is inconsistent with freedom of inter-State trade etc. This on certain views, might possibly prove material in this case for when the alleged offence took place The State Transport Facilities Acts and Another Act Amendment Act of 1959 had not of course been passed. (at p469)

18. But the question remains whether the amendments did destroy the uniformity of the application of the contribution to road maintenance charge. (at p469)

19. The amendment affected in no way the legal operation of The Roads (Contribution to Maintenance) Acts. The same people remained under the same obligations to pay the same sums of money in the same events. The money thus raised fell into the same fund and continued applicable exclusively to road maintenance. What it did was to treat the payment so made by a person who also incurred a liability to another exaction - a tax - as a ground of relief pro tanto from that exaction. Now this concession could not matter unless in some way it gave an advantage to the carriers obtaining it over inter-State carriers. It does not increase the liabilities of inter-State carriers; it does not reduce the liability of intra-State carriers to the contribution to roads maintenance charge. What it does is to reduce pro tanto the latter's liability, from which the inter-State carrier is free, to pay licence fees. Now if licence fees were something more than a tax, if they were the price of a valuable right, as for example licence fees to exercise a patent might be, one could see that by the reduction of price something was being actually given to the licensee. Reduction of tax no doubt is itself a benefit but it could not operate to prefer the intra-State licensed carrier to the inter-State carrier because the latter never pays the fee and needs no licence. To produce such a preference it is necessary to find some positive benefit placing the intra-State carrier in a superior position to that occupied by the inter-State man. This was realized by counsel for the defendant, who however sought to meet it by establishing that a licence conferred a monopoly of value, and that to reduce the licence fee by the amount of the charge meant a real advantage to the licensee giving him, in the consequent inadequacy of the payment for the monopoly conferred by the licence, not merely an advantage in itself but an advantage over the inter-State carrier. For this counsel relied upon (1) the legislative requirement of a licence, (2) the discretion to grant or refuse it, (3) the policy or intention ascribed to the provisions that licences should not be granted without regard to the needs of the routes, and (4) the provisions already referred to as to the transfer of licences. These considerations, however, are of insufficient certainty and strength to establish the conclusion. The inference which must be drawn to make it possible for the argument to succeed is that as between the inter-State operator and the intra-State operator the total effect of the legislation is to put the latter in a better position than the former with respect to an equivalent operation. That inference is one that has not been established and is one which I am certainly not prepared to draw. (at p470)

20. For the foregoing reasons I think that s. 3 of The Roads (Contribution to Maintenance) Acts 1957 to 1958 validly applied to the defendant in May and June 1958 and he was rightly convicted under s. 8 (1) (e). (at p470)

21. The appeal should be dismissed. (at p470)

This is an application to review the decision of the District Registrar in Brisbane disallowing certain items upon taxation of appellant's bill of costs, which costs arose out of an appeal by the appellant against his assessment to land tax in respect of certain Crown leaseholds in Queensland.

The items so disallowed fall into three groups. Items 2-22 form the first group, and consist of notices of objection to assessments for various years and in respect of various leaseholds, requests to the Commissioner that the taxpayer required such notices to be treated as appeals and transmitted to the High Court, letters refusing to accept amended assessments from time to time issued by the Commissioner and insisting on the transmission of the objections, and attendances on the Commissioner and his officers. In my opinion the notices of objection (items 2-13) form the very keystone of the appeal of the taxpayer to this Court. Mr. Herring contended that it is the request to forward the notices that constitutes the appeal, but I cannot agree with that contention. The request merely sets the appeal in motion, but having been set in motion, the thing which is before the Court is the taxpayer's notice of objection, and it is the foundation of the appeal. As soon as the letter requesting that the notice of objection be transmitted to the Court is sent, there is a relation back to the notice of objection itself which becomes the appeal. That being so, I consider the remaining items in this first group necessary and proper steps in the appeal, and I accordingly allow the appellant the costs of items 2-22.

Four items comprise the second group of objections, namely, 47, 79, 83 and 87. Item 47 relates to the perusal by appellant's solicitor of transcripts of reports of Royal Commissions appointed by the Commonwealth Government to inquire into the proper method of valuation of Crown leaseholds in Australia. Items 83 and 87 refer to copies for counsel of the address of Mr. Owen Dixon K.C. (as he then was) before the last of those Commissions. So far as items 47 and 79 are concerned I propose to allow the objection. Solicitors are responsible for giving proper and adequate instructions to counsel: it is not sufficient to collect a mass of documents and pass them over to counsel to do their best or their worst with. It is a solicitor's duty to instruct counsel, and it was necessary in this case, in order to instruct them fully, to peruse these reports and to select relevant portions of them for the purpose (inter alia) of cross-examination of departmental witnesses who had given evidence before the Royal Commissions. If the solicitor in this case had come before the Court without having done this work, he would have neglected his duty. It was manifest that the very thing which had been submitted to Royal Commissions for solution was now propounded to the Court. I therefore allow items 47 and 79; and, agreeing with appellant's objections as to items 83 and 87, I also allow them, provided, however, that they are not included in item 79.

The third group is really comprised of item 118 relating to counsel's fees and refreshers. The first question here involved is whether the appellant was justified in sending Victorian counsel to the hearing of the appeal in Brisbane. In my opinion, and I was the Judge who heard the appeal, such a course was justified. This is a Federal Court and the case was a Federal case, and a litigant in proper circumstances is entitled to select counsel from within the Commonwealth and, in my opinion, such circumstances were present in this case.

This was not an ordinary case. It was a test case and the judgment fixed the method of valuation of Crown leaseholds and has been acted upon since by the Commissioner and taxpayer appellants in the preparation and conduct of their respective cases. Mr. Owen Dixon K.C. (as he then was) and Mr. Russell Martin having appeared before the last of the Royal Commissions were on that account considered by the solicitor, and on good grounds, to be eminently fitted to handle such a case as this. It was a wise and proper precaution for the solicitor to brief the counsel he thought the most familiar with this type of case. I am not dealing now with individuals, I am dealing with a principle: the case was of great importance both to the Department, to the appellant and to Crown leaseholders in general; it dealt with the method of valuation of great tracts of land and involved questions both of law and fact. In my opinion appellant might reasonably have asked for the costs of three counsel and not those of two. The second question raised by this objection, namely, the allowance of refreshers beyond the maxima fixed by O. LIV., r. 60, of the High Court Rules, turns on the effect of r. 42 of that Order upon r. 60. I think it is clear that r. 42 gives the taxing officer a discretion in special circumstances, such as there are in this case, to go beyond the maxima for refreshers set out in r. 60. (See Cavendish v. Strutt[1] ; Stewart & Co. v. Weber[2] , and In re Ermen; Tatham v. Ermen[3] .) These cases were all decided long before the present High Court Rules came into being, and the Judges who drew up these Rules must be taken to have known the English Rules (upon which our Rules are based) and the construction applied to those English rules, and this construction must be taken to have been adopted in the High Court Rules. For these reasons I propose to refer item 118 back to the learned District Registrar on the question of quantum and with the observations that this case is one which justifies the briefing of counsel from one State to attend the hearing in another State and that r. 60 is subject to r. 42.

 I agree that this appeal be allowed. (at p442)

2. The learned trial judge, Kriewaldt J., has stated the evidence which he accepted in proof of the allegation of adultery; it is unnecessary for me to state it again. That evidence affords clear proof of the adultery alleged. There is nothing in the case to diminish its probative force. The judgment appealed from is, in my opinion, clearly against the evidence and the weight of evidence. In a proceeding under the ordinance of the Northern Territory relating to divorce and matrimonial causes, it is the duty of the court (where, as here, there is no absolute or discretionary bar), "upon being satisfied as to the existence of any ground" on which divorce is claimed, to grant the order. In respect of the standard of proof, the ordinance does not differentiate between adultery and any other ground. The proofs of the adultery alleged in this case, rested on a solid setting of circumstantial evidence, reinforced with direct evidence of habitual guilty association between the defendant and co-defendant. Besides, the learned judge did not believe their denials of adultery. He said in the course of the reasons for judgment that "it is quite probable they committed adultery", but that, having regard to "the gravity of the issues involved" in the allegation, he was unable to say that he was satisfied that adultery was committed. He added that with evidence of equal probative strength on an issue such as whether a small sum of money was not paid he would be satisfied that it was not. His Honour was, of course, right in making this distinction. However, the learned judge said that under the ordinance, the strict criminal standard of proof is not applicable to an allegation of adultery. I agree in that view. His Honour's ultimate conclusion is that he was not satisfied that a finding of adultery would be "true"; and for that reason he refused to make an order for divorce. With respect, I am of opinion that the satisfaction which the learned judge felt that he should have, is a higher state of certitude than being satisfied, upon the evidence, as to the existence of the ground on which divorce is claimed. It is the latter degree of certitude which s. 12 of the ordinance requires. What led the learned judge to decline to act upon the proofs of adultery which were adduced was the apparent disbelief of the present appellant and the co-defendant's husband that adultery was being committed. Such a consideration, if admissible, should not countervail to rebut the strong inferences of guilt to be drawn from the circumstantial and even more direct evidence that it had been in fact committed.

This case stated raises the question whether by the operation of conferred upon this Court to hear and determine an appeal from a decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks in opposition proceedings. The Trade Marks Act 1905-1948 has been repealed by s. 4 of the Trade Marks Act 1955-1958 but for certain purposes it is kept alive by s. 5 of that Act and as a result it still governs applications for registration made before the repeal. The case is stated in an appeal concerning an application so made and pending at the time of the adoption of the Trade Marks Act 1955. (at p656)

2. The provision really in question is s. 44 which is as follows: - "(1) Any party aggrieved by the decision of the Law Officer may in the time and in the manner prescribed appeal to the Court. (2) The Court shall hear the applicant and the opponent, and determine whether the application ought to be refused or ought to be granted with or without any modifications or conditions." The decision of the Law Officer to which s. 44 relates is the latter's determination of an appeal from a decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks upon an opposition. Section 45 provides that if either party so desires and gives written notice of his desire an appeal shall be taken direct from the registrar to the Court without any appeal to the Law Officer. It does no more than provide a procedure for invoking the jurisdiction which s. 44 purports to give. "The Court" is an expression defined by s. 4. It means the High Court or the Supreme Court of the State in which the Trade Marks Office is situate or a Justice thereof. It is s. 43 that gives an appeal to the Law Officer. The section is as follows : - "(1) Any party aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar may in the time and in the manner prescribed appeal to the Law Officer. (2) The Law Officer shall hear the applicant and the opponent, and may determine whether the application ought to be refused or ought to be granted with or without any modifications or conditions." The expression "Law Officer" is also defined by s. 4. It means the Attorney-General or Crown Solicitor of the Commonwealth. By the Solicitor-General Act 1916, s. 3 (1), however, the Attorney-General is authorized to delegate his powers and functions under an Act to the Solicitor-General and this power to delegate would extend to such a function as that vested in him by s. 43 of the Trade Marks Act 1905-1948 to hear an appeal from the registrar. The result is that an appeal may be made from the registrar to the Law Officer and one or other of these three officers may hear the appeal. Alternatively, under s. 45 an appeal may be taken direct to the Court. (at p657)

3. An attack is made upon s. 44 as an attempt to con'er upon this Court functions which lie outside the judicial power of the Commonwealth. It will be seen from the definition of "Court" that the provision purports also to confer power on the Supreme Court of a State. To confer judicial power on this Court in such a matter it was necessary for the Parliament to exercise the legislative power given by s. 76 (ii) of the Constitution. To confer it upon the Supreme Court of a State it was necessary to exercise that given by s. 77 (iii) of the Constitution. Section 76 (ii) provides that the Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction upon the High Court in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament. Section 77 provides that with respect to any of the matters mentioned in s. 76, as well as those covered by s. 75, the Parliament may make laws investing any court of a State with federal jurisdiction. (at p657)

4. Clearly enough opposition proceedings arise under a law of the Commonwealth. On the one side the applicant claims in such proceedings to be entitled to registration of a trade mark. On the other side the opponent denies his right. There does not seem to be any reason in the nature of things why such an issue of right should not be submitted to the original jurisdiction of this Court or of the Supreme Court of a State for determination. But of course it must be submitted as a judicial matter to be determined by an exercise of the judicial power. The fact that the proceedings, although necessarily belonging to the original jurisdiction, are called an appeal is of little or no importance. What is of importance is whether the jurisdiction which the section purports to confer is not only a jurisdiction with respect to a matter lying within the nine matters referred to in ss. 75 and 76 but is so conferred as to involve the exercise of judicial power. The nature of opposition proceedings in an application for trade mark is well enough known. Under s. 38 of the Act of 1905-1948 any person might lodge with the Trade Marks Office a notice of opposition to the registration of a trade mark setting out his grounds. It was the duty of the registrar to send a duplicate of the notice of opposition to the applicant (s. 40). The applicant was required to lodge a counter-statement (s. 41). The registrar then fixed a day for the hearing of the application and on the day so fixed he heard the applicant for the trade mark and the opponent and decided whether the application was to be refused or whether it was to be granted either with or without any modification or conditions (s. 42). It is from that decision that s. 43 gave the party aggrieved an appeal to the Law Officer. From the Law Officer's decision s. 44 conferred a right of appeal to the Court. Clearly enough an opposition involves an assertion on the part of the applicant and a denial on the part of the opponent of a claim of right. And "a claim of right" is the test of a "matter" formulated in In re Judiciary and Navigation Acts [1921] HCA 20; (1921) 29 CLR 257 . (at p658)

5. The right to registration of a trade mark depends upon the fulfilment of a number of objective conditions which the Act prescribes both positively and negatively. It is enough to mention the definition of "trade mark" in s. 4, the essential particulars referred to in ss. 15 and 16, and the disqualifications referred to in s. 25 and in s. 114. The statute might have drawn a clear distinction between on the one hand the administrative decision to give effect to an opposition and refuse registration or to overrule an opposition and grant registration and on the other hand a jurisdiction conferred upon the Court to entertain a challenge to the administrative decision and determine judicially that the title to registration did or did not exist and to do so by a binding and enforceable decree. If that had been done no difficulty could be found in treating the provision conferring such a jurisdiction upon the Court as a valid exercise of the legislative power conferred by s. 76 (ii) or s. 77 (iii) as the case might be. It would have been but another instance of the kind of thing done by Div. 2 of Pt. V of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1957. Cf. Steele v. Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Board (1955) 92 CLR 177, at pp 186, 187 ; The Commonwealth v. Anderson [1957] HCA 44; (1957) 97 CLR 345 ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Munro [1926] HCA 58; (1926) 38 CLR 153 . But the distinction was not maintained in the language which the legislature adopted with reference to the registrar, the Law Officer and the Court in ss. 42 to 45. This is also true with respect to appeals from a refusal to accept an application which are dealt with by ss. 34 and 35. In other words, the contention advanced before us is to be attributed to the use by the legislature of the same or similar terms in describing the administrative power which ss. 42 and 43 purport to confer and the judicial power which ss. 44 and 45 purport to confer. It is not surprising that similarity of expression has given rise to the argument that one or other provision must be bad; and since it is not assumed that judicial power has been conferred on administrative officers the contention is that the truth must be that it was intended to confer an administrative power on the Court. In support of this latter view it is contended that s. 44 does not intend to give a power the exercise of which is definite. It is suggested that although on an appeal by an applicant or an opponent the Court is to determine whether the application ought to be refused or ought to be granted the decision of the Court is not necessarily binding and there is nothing to enforce a decision in favour of the grant of registration or for that matter a decision in favour of the refusal of registration. This argument does not appear to be well founded. Section 47 should probably be construed as imposing upon the registrar an imperative duty to register when the Court has decided against an opposition. It is true that in s. 47 the words "unless otherwise prescribed by the regulations" may seem to qualify the duty but these words appear to affect only the date to be given to the registration. A regulation did exist which assumed that these words bore a wider interpretation. It is now repealed. It was reg. 38 of the Trade Marks Regulations 1913-1950. As it is repealed little need be said about it. A comparison of the regulation with s. 47, however, should be enough to show that it exceeded any power that s. 47 could confer. Apart from s. 47 there is a clear implication in s. 44 that the exercise of the judicial power that provision purports to confer shall be conclusive upon the registrar as well as upon the parties. The determination of the Court that the application should be refused necessarily means that the application is at an end. In the same way a determination of the Court that the application ought to be granted leaves nothing but the administrative steps necessary to express a grant. (at p659)

6. There is therefore in s. 44 a provision which is apt to confer judicial power and relates to a fit subject matter for judicial power: the subject involves a matter within the meaning of s. 76 (ii) of the Constitution: in the character of the provision itself, in the manner in which the power is to be exercised or in the subject no reason can be found for denying that it forms a proper exercise of the constitutional power conferred by that provision and the provision contained in s. 77 (iii) of the Constitution. (at p659)

7. We are not concerned on this occasion with the validity of the provision giving an appeal to the Law Officer but there is nothing in what has been said to cast doubt upon the operation of s. 43. The decision of the Privy Council as well as of this Court in the case of the Shell Oil Company named in this Court British Imperial Oil Co. Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1926] HCA 58; (1926) 38 CLR 153; (1931) AC 275; (1930) 44 CLR 530 is enough to show that words which might otherwise be sufficient to confer judicial power may be governed by the context as well as by the character of the body or person upon whom the power is conferred and may be construed as going no further than granting administrative power. They must of course be consistent in their content with that construction but that is a condition which s. 43 satisfies. (at p660)

8. For the foregoing reasons the question in the special case should be answered Yes. The respondent should pay the costs of the special case. (at p660)

The appellant passed a resolution pursuant to s. 99 of the Local Government Act, 1919 (as amended) (N.S.W.), directing an inquiry to be held with a view to terminating the employment of its servant, the respondent. A lengthy inquiry was duly held and in accordance with the provisions of s. 99 a report was furnished to the Council and the Minister for Local Government. The report was, in conformity with the section, read at a meeting of the Council and thereafter a resolution was passed. The resolution stated that the Council in accordance with the findings of an inquiry under s. 99 "terminated" the employment of the respondent. He thereupon made an application to the Minister for an order under s. 99 (11A) of the Act for payment by the Council to him of compensation. The Minister sent a copy of the application to the Council and invited it to submit its views and to state any grounds of opposition to the payment of compensation. In its reply the Council set forth the matters which, it alleged, established that the report was not substantially favourable to the respondent. Subsequently the Department of Local Government sent to the appellant Council an instrument in writing signed by the Minister for Local Government directing the Council to pay compensation to the respondent in the sum of $1,800. The Council passed a resolution that the compensation be not paid and that the Council institute proceedings to challenge the validity of the Minister's direction. The proceedings were instituted in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The learned primary judge decided in favour of the Council (1969) 17 LGRA 148 . His decision was reversed on appeal. The Council appeals to this Court from the decision of the Court of Appeal (1970) 91 WN (NSW) 396; 20 LGRA 332 . (at p661)

2. It is not alleged by the Council that the direction of the Minister was not a bona fide exercise of the power conferred by s. 99 (11A) of the Act. The question at issue between the Council and the Minister was whether the report was "substantially favourable" to the respondent. The exercise of the power given to the Minister necessarily involves, I think, an adjudication on the question whether "the report of the person holding the inquiry is substantially favourable to the servant". In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Munro [1926] HCA 58; (1926) 38 CLR 153, at p 176 , Isaacs J. said:

    "The power and function of finally determining matters of fact
    and even of discretion are not solely indicative of judicial
    action. That is an attribute common to administrative bodies, to
    subordinate bodies that are adjuncts to legislation, and to
    judicial bodies." (at p661)


3. In my opinion it is implied in the provisions of sub-s. (11A) that the Minister is given the power and the responsibility of finally determining whether the report is "substantially favourable" to the dismissed servant. The Minister is authorized by the subsection to make the determination "after such inquiry as he deems sufficient". The question whether the report is "substantially favourable" is therefore not merely a question of construction but a question to be determined by the Minister "after such inquiry as he deems sufficient". It does not seem to me that the provisions of the subsection contemplate that a direction given by the Minister pursuant to the subsection should be open to challenge in a court merely on an allegation that the report was not substantially favourable to the dismissed servant. It would not be enough to set aside the report that the court was of an opinion different from that of the Minister on that question. In my view it is not appropriate to decide here whether the report is substantially favourable or not. It is sufficient to say that the report does not disclose anything which shows that the Minister could not reasonably have arrived at the conclusion that the report was substantially favourable. I agree entirely with the reasons of Mason J.A. on the question of the nature and extent of the authority of the Minister. (at p662)

4. The appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed. (at p662)

I am of opinion that upon the proper construction of s. 40 (2) of the Factories, Shops and Industries Act, 1962, the onus of proving that there was a secure foothold, and that a handhold was either secure or unnecessary, lay upon the defendant. As I dissent on the question it is not necessary for me to say more than that I think Wallace P. and Jacobs J.A. correctly construed s. 40 (2) and I agree with what each of their Honours said on this point. Their conclusion has, in my view, the support of the majority of the House of Lords in Nimmo v. Alexander Cowan & Sons Ltd. (1968) AC 107 and of the decisions cited by Mr. Sullivan on the same problem of distinguishing between a qualification and an exception. There was, in my opinion, therefore, a case to go to the jury on the count based on allegations of a breach of the defendant's duty under s. 40 (2) and also a case to go to the jury on count one, which was for negligence at common law. I think that the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Wallace P. and Jacobs J.A., are right. I would dismiss the appeal. (at p348)

In my opinion the matters alleged in the statement of claim would not support a declaration of the nature of any of the declarations sought by the plaintiff, because, in my view, it does not disclose that the Stamp Act, 1921-1967, impairs the freedom of the plaintiff's inter-State commerce to which the statement of claim refers. (at p107)

2. The Court was not referred to any decision on the precise question whether a receipt given by a carrier in relation to money paid to him as reward for inter-State carriage by him of goods or passengers is exempt from stamp duty charged upon the receipt by a legislative Act ; nor to a dictum of the Court on the question. (at p107)

3. The statement in Grannall v. Marrickville Margarine Pty. Ltd. [1955] HCA 6; (1955) 93 CLR 55, at p 78 was relied upon to support a right in the plaintiff to the declarations it claims. I do not think that this statement is decisive in the plaintiff's favour of the contention that the freedom of its inter-State commerce is impaired by the provisions of the Stamp Act relating to receipts. It seems to me that it is not easy to hold that the giving of a receipt upon which the Act charges stamp duty is a

    "fact or event or thing which itself forms part of trade, commerce
    or intercourse or forms an essential attribute of that conception
    (essential in the sense that without it you cannot bring into being
    that particular example of trade, commerce and intercourse among the
    States)". (at p107)


4. In my view the provisions of the Stamp Act relating to a receipt or a s. 99B "statement" are not restrictive of trade, commerce or intercourse among the States. It is not necessary in order to say that trade is "free" that the trader should be free from an obligation imposed by a statute to give receipts to his customers or that the receipts he issues should not be dutiable. I reach the conclusion that the plaintiff's constitutional freedom accorded to him by s. 92 to carry goods in the course of his trade, commerce and intercourse among the States suffers no impairment by the operation of the Stamp Act ; and that the Act does not impose a burden on this activity, incompatible with s. 92. (at p107)

5. The reasoning in Hughes & Vale Pty. Ltd. v. New South Wales (No. 2) [1955] HCA 28; (1955) 93 CLR 127, at pp 162, 172 in my view, supports the contention for the State of Western Australia that the Stamp Act does not contravene s. 92 as alleged by the plaintiff. I take the view that the stamp duty imposed by this Act on a "receipt" within the meaning of that Act, or on a s. 99B statement is an example of a fiscal liability similar to those mentioned at the bottom of p. 172 of the report of the last-mentioned case ; and that the provisions of the Act imposing stamp duty on receipts belong to that concept of "law" of which s. 92 assumes the existence, and with which the section does not intend to interfere : see observation of Griffith C.J. in Duncan v. Queensland [1916] HCA 67; (1916) 22 CLR 556, at p 573 approved in The Commonwealth v. Bank of New South Wales (1949) 79 CLR 497, at p 639 (at p108)

DIXON J. delivered the following written judgment:-
This is an appeal from an assessment to income tax for the financial year twelve months ending 28th February 1942. The appellant, an incorporated trading company, carried on the business of transporting passengers and goods by air in Papua and New Guinea. The base for its air services was Lae in New Guinea. There it had hangars workshops stores and other buildings. On 21st January 1942 the Japanese Air Force bombed Lae and the company's building stores and equipment were destroyed. Among the property destroyed were large quantities of spare parts for the airframes and engines of the company's aeroplanes. In accordance with the common practice of air transport services the company maintained a large stock of spare parts. The spare parts were stored in bins whence they were drawn as occasion required. In addition to the stock of spare parts for aeroplanes the company also carried at Lae a store of equipment and other things needed for the maintenance of the depot. This too was destroyed. In respect of its various losses as a result of the bombing at Lae the company claimed compensation under the National Security (War Damage to Property) Regulations. In pursuance of reg. 38 the War Damage Commission assessed the amount of the loss and recorded it. At that time under reg. 38 (3) the amount of compensation assessed and recorded was to be tentative only and did not become payable until the end of hostilities, when it might be reviewed. The law was afterwards changed by S.R. No. 4 of 1945. The amount at which the War Damage Commission recorded the loss in respect of spares for aircraft was 19,570 pounds and the loss in respect of general stores 7,510 pounds. The aircraft stores stood in the books of the company at a figure which may be taken to be 25,361 pounds and the general stores at 7,702 pounds. The difference is in the one case 5,791 pounds and in the other 192 pounds, making in all 5,983 pounds. This difference the company claims to deduct from its assessable income in arriving at the taxable income of the accounting period. The accounts in which stood the respective figures of 25,361 pounds for aircraft stores and of 7,702 pounds for general stores consisted in the one case of an assets account known as the Aircraft Spares Account and in the other of an analogous account called the General Stores Account. When aircraft spares were purchased and taken into store at Lae the Aircraft Spares Account was debited with the cost into store consisting of the prime cost together with freight insurance duty and other charges. When spare parts were drawn and issued from the store for use, an amount was charged against running costs consisting of the cost into store of the spare parts so issued with ten per cent added. The corresponding credit of the amount so charged was divided into two. The added ten per cent was credited to an account called the Reserve for Depreciation Aircraft Spares New Guinea Account. The cost into store was credited to the assets account called the Aircraft Spares Account. The result would be that the debit balance of this latter account should show the cost into store of the aircraft spares which had been taken into the bins and had not been issued. The same system of accounting was applied to the General Stores Account. In the balance sheet of the company apparently it was the practice to show the total of the debit balances of the two accounts on the assets side under "Inventory: Spare Parts: Stores etc. less Depreciation". But at what figure does not appear, since the balance sheet in evidence is compiled as at 28th February 1942 after the bombing and shows the war damage claim as an asset. It was not explained why the War Damage Commission recorded the amount of compensation at 5,983 pounds less than the book value of the spare parts and stores but there is something to suggest that the amount disallowed represents articles that had been in stock so long as to be obsolete or to have depreciated, possibly through deterioration. (at p586)

2. The sum of 5,983 pounds which the company claims to deduct from its assessable income may thus represent a loss in value that had in fact accrued, but had not been ascertained, before the bombing. It may however represent part of the existing value of what was destroyed by the bombing, a part that the company has failed to recover from the War Damage Commission. (at p586)

3. In either view the company claims that the loss is deductible under s. 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1942. In my opinion this contention of the company must fail on the ground that the loss was a loss of capital or of a capital nature. (at p586)

4. The company had formed or built up a reservoir of spares for aircraft and of stores of considerable size and value and maintained it as part of its permanent establishment. It does not appear whether it had been built up gradually or formed initially, but it is immaterial which way it was done. To maintain an available stock of spares and stores at a proper level the requisite amount of capital must be committed to the purpose. The ingredients in the stocks might change. Spares would be drawn and new spares taken into store in the ordinary course of business. But the stock of spares remained. The existence of the stock of spares was a feature of the permanent organization of the enterprise. It formed part of the general equipment. When spare parts were issued and taken into use, it was right no doubt to debit the cost to running expenses, though whether for purposes of income tax the ten per cent could be added is another matter. But it by no means follows that the spare parts constituting the reservoir represented anything but capital. Moreover the stocks did not represent circulating capital. Money was not laid out in the purchase of spare parts and then recovered, together with a profit, on their resale. Stock in trade, because of its nature and function, is valued at the beginning and end of an accounting period and if any part of it is lost or destroyed in the interval the loss is reflected in the comparison of the two values. But the permanent stock of spare parts and stores forms part of the profit yielding subject, as Lord Blackburn called it in United Collieries v. I.R.C. (1929) 12 TC 1248, at p 1254 ; cf. Sun Newspapers Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1938) 61 CLR 337, at pp 359-363 . In Abbott v. Albion Greyhounds Ltd. (1945) 1 All ER 308 it was agreed that the cost of buying greyhounds for the purpose of filling gaps in the kennels of a dog racing company was a deductible expense, but a distinction was drawn between that and raising or increasing the establishment, which, as I read it, Wrottesley J. considered would involve a capital expenditure, as the Crown said. The racing life of a dog is less than two years. But the dogs were not the company's stock in trade to be valued. That case provides an illustration of the principle. (at p587)

5. The stores and the spare parts have not gone into use or consumption. The sums of 7,702 pounds and 25,361 pounds which the company said was their value was money locked up in the bins and the stores with the stocks of spares and other things they always contained. The reservoir of spare parts and stores is from a business point of view an entity existing independently of the changing identity of the elements forming it. The loss that the company has suffered simply represents part of the value of the entity. There has never been any attempt in the company's accounts to treat the expenditure incurred in establishing it, or in building it up, as a revenue expenditure. No debit was made to revenue account until a spare part was issued and went into use. No part of the 25,361 pounds or the 7,702 pounds is or has been reflected in profit and loss. For these reasons I think that the loss is one of capital or at all events is of a capital nature and cannot be deducted under s. 51. (at p588)

6. The commissioner relied upon further answers to the company's use of s. 51 in support of its claim to the deduction. But, as I accept the commissioner's view that the loss is an affair of capital, it is unnecessary to discuss them. (at p588)

7. On behalf of the company, however, some reliance was placed on s.59. Section 59 could not apply unless the spares or the stores, as the case may be, were brought within s. 54. Even if they could be treated as "plant" within that provision, which I doubt, I do not think that it could be said that that thay had been used during the year for the purpose of producing assessable income or had been installed ready for use for that purpose. These, or one of them, form essential conditions of the application of s. 54. (at p588)

8. In my opinion the claim to deduct the loss fails. The appeal will be dismissed with costs. (at p588)

9. From this decision Guinea Airways Ltd. appealed to the Full Court. (at p588)

Order nisi for prohibition directed to the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and summons under sec. 21AA of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1930, heard together. The proceedings sought to be prohibited and declared incompetent are pending before Judge Drake-Brockman. They arise out of applications made by the Australian Railways Union for an order or orders varying an award made by Sir John Quick on 25th March 1930 the terms of which have, since that date, been the subject of much variation and alteration. The variations and alterations made in the award up to the proceedings now in question originated in the rapid change of conditions from the date when the award was pronounced which took place as the result of the financial depression. The award of Sir John Quick was a consolidation of many awards which he had made in relation to the Victorian Railways in the course of settling a dispute between the organization and the Railways Commissioners of the State of Victoria and three other States. Up to the making of the award half the period of the siege of Troy had been occupied in settling the dispute. The remainder of that period has since elapsed but we are told that the dispute is still alive and not yet completely settled. The award was expressed to have a currency ending on 31st December 1931. But on 4th October 1930 it was set aside except in so far as it prescribed a basic wage and standard hours of work. The difficulties of jurisdiction created by that order were dealt with at the time in this Court (Australian Railways Union v. Victorian Railways Commissioners[9]). In the following January the wages prescribed were reduced by ten per cent by an order of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, an order which was rescinded on 17th April 1934 when a new basic wage was prescribed. All these orders, including, in my opinion, the so-called setting aside order, amounted to orders of variation. Last October the organization applied to the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for the reinstatement of the terms of the consolidated award. This is not the first of such applications. The Full Court of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration expressed the view which it had also before expressed that the great change in economic and industrial conditions precluded such a course. It recommended that fresh proceedings, founded, as I understand, on some new dispute, should be taken in order that a new regulation of wages and conditions might be obtained. The organization nevertheless took the course of resorting to the old dispute which arose ten years before, and without raising any fresh dispute applied to Judge Drake-Brockman for orders of variation of Sir John Quick's award. That award was kept alive from 31st December 1931, the date of its expiration, only by the force of sec. 28 (2) of the Act. Power to vary it is given by sub-sec. 3. Upon the history of the legislation there is much to be said for the view that it is the only power to vary an award the specified period of which has ended (see the discussion by Evatt J. in Australian Insurance Staffs' Federation v. Atlas Assurance Co.[10]). The Victorian Railways Commissioners objected that under this power Judge Drake-Brockman could not engage in a reconsideration or consideration of the terms and conditions appropriate to the present time for the regulation of the railway industry in Victoria. His Honor treated the ten year old dispute as still subsisting and as retaining enough vitality to give him jurisdiction.

I have before remarked upon the attempts to press to an impossible extension the already very wide interpretation which sec. 51 (XXXV.) of the Constitution has received in this Court (see Federated State School Teachers' Association of Australia v. Victoria[11]; Australian Insurance Staffs' Federation v. Atlas Assurance Co.[12]). To repeat what I said in the latter case, "Liberal, however, as has been the application of the limitations imposed by the Constitution upon the Federal power, those limitations cannot be escaped. But the very width of application which has been given to them has increased the difficulties of ascertaining the boundaries of the power. The enlargement by judicial decision has been progressive, and has been accomplished by the double process of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration making, whether by experiment or otherwise, awards the validity of which was uncertain or disputable, and this Court resolving the doubt in favour of that Court's decision. As a result, perhaps less certainty of definition has been achieved than might be desired, but only an optimist could hope at once for a widening jurisdiction and fixity of definition. But at no time had there been any doubt that the existence and the ambit of a dispute determine the power of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to embody its will in an award. To go outside matters in a dispute and to regulate wages or conditions otherwise than by a decree which is fairly incident to composing the difference between the parties is neither to arbitrate nor to settle an industrial dispute"[13]. Every constitutional power has limits, and however liberally it may be construed the limits are at length reached and an attempt is then made to go beyond them. It may be true that when an award is made settling an existing dispute the then existence of the dispute is enough to support afterwards the industrial regulation contained in the award; but it is an extreme deduction from that principle that a dispute which existed ten years ago can be settled all over again and form the foundation of a new and up-to-date regulation of industrial terms and conditions. In my opinion the award of Sir John Quick as varied remains in force only by virtue of sec. 28 (2). The power of the Court further to vary rests exclusively upon the theory that an award continued in force may be varied in order to prevent its continuance in force operating unjustly. (See Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v. Commonwealth Steamship Owners' Association[14].) It is continued in force to bridge a gap, namely the gap between the termination of its specified period and a new award in a new dispute. But the bridge over the gap may be reconditioned by the power of variation lest in changing conditions it grows altogether unsuitable for the purpose. A new bridge cannot be constructed. The reconditioning cannot extend beyond those repairs and adjustments necessary to preserve a useful structure. If the bridge is removed, another industrial regulation cannot be put in its place unless there is a living dispute which really requires settlement to compose the then existing controversy. I gather from Judge Drake-Brockman's observations that he did not take this limited view of his functions. Much of what he said is open to the interpretation that he regarded himself under a burden comparable to that which engrossed the labours of Sir John Quick until he made his award in 1930. As a first step his Honor pronounced what he described as an interim award. His doing so provoked the present applications to this Court. When they came on to be argued the interim award as drawn up was not available and we experienced some difficulty in obtaining from the materials before us and the discrepant contentions of the parties a clear apprehension of what his Honor had done. After the argument, however, we were furnished with a copy of the instrument. The text was not in accordance with what I had been led to expect. The parties, however, by a joint memorandum adopted a construction or interpretation of the interim award in which they concurred. Each furnished in support of the interpretation separate memoranda in which their tendency to agree was by no means so marked. It is satisfactory, however, to find them concurring in the substantial effect which they think should be given to the award, from whatever motive their concurrence may spring. It is no less satisfactory because I myself without their aid would probably not have hit upon the meaning which thus has been ascribed to the award. They agree that by the interim award it is intended to award, for six months from 29th November 1934 unless in the meantime it is otherwise ordered and subject to certain qualifications, that the terms of the consolidated award of 25th March 1930 should be in force, including the marginal payments and all other parts of the award which had been set aside in 1930. The qualifications mentioned, put briefly, are that deductions may be made not greater than those authorized by State law, and that all other variations made in the meantime shall apply. Clause 6 of the interim award provided as follows: "This award shall be an interim award and shall come into operation on 29th November 1934 and shall continue in force for the period of six months." Clause 3 provides that "all the provisions of the consolidated award as varied to date are to be deemed to be incorporated herein." Now, whatever else may be said of the interim award, there can be no doubt that by these clauses, particularly as they have been interpreted by the parties, it establishes referentially rates and conditions to govern the industry for a specified period of six months. This appears to me to be quite outside the power given by sec. 28 (3) to the Court of varying an expired award continued in force by sec. 28 (2). It is an attempt to make an interim award as if a dispute were still unsettled and as if the Court were making an award to which sec. 28 (1) applied. No doubt it could be terminated before the expiration of six months, but so could any award made under sec. 28 (1) be brought to an end before the expiration of its period.

The rule nisi should, in my opinion, be made absolute to prohibit proceedings upon this so-called interim award. The Commissioners do not appear to have a locus standi under sec. 21AA and prohibition is therefore the appropriate remedy. The summons should be dismissed.

This is an appeal from a decision of the Full Court of New South executor against the Commissioner, as a nominal defendant, to recover from the State of New South Wales an amount paid as death duty, erroneously assessed by the Commissioner. The action is brought under s. 140 of the Stamp Duties Act, 1920-1959 (N.S.W.). The questions involved were brought before the Supreme Court by demurrer to pleas. Two pleas were involved. By the first plea the Commissioner sought to rely upon a defence that the over-exaction of duty was caused by a mistake on his part in the construction of the Stamp Duties Act. Section 140(1) provides, inter alia, that no refund shall be made in respect of any property wrongly included in the dutiable estate of any person . . . by reason of any mistake in the construction of this Act". (at p382)

2. The facts to be collected from the pleadings are set out in detail in the judgment of Taylor J., which I have had the benefit of reading and in the reasoning of which I agree. (at p382)

3. The essential question raised by the first plea is the nature of the cause of the overpayment. Is it correct that the cause of the Commissioner's wrongly including the estate of A.J. Annabel deceased in the dutiable estate of his daughter, Vera Madeline Crowther, was a mistake on his part in the construction of the Stamp Duties Act? Giving the widest meaning to the word "construction", I cannot see that it was such a mistake. It was due to a misunderstanding of the operation of s. 29 of the Wills, Probate and Administration Act, 1898 (N.S.W.). I agree entirely with the judgment of Herron C.J. on this point and, in particular, I agree in the following statement of his Honour:- "In the present case the Commissioner's essential mistake was as to the true effect of s. 29 of the Wills, Probate and Administration Act, 1898. He was also mistaken in thinking that the fiction which its provisions create applied to the Stamp Duties Act at all. Section 29, on the facts of this case, created no right in property which became part of the estate of Vera Madeline Crowther. The Commissioner erroneously thought that it did. This was not due to a misconstruction of s. 102(1)(a) or as to the meaning of property, but to a misunderstanding of the law relating to wills expressed in the Wills, Probate and Administration Act" (1962) 80 WN (NSW), at p 980 . (at p383)

4. The second plea does not extend to the whole action, but to a large sum, parcel of the money claimed. Section 140(4) provides that no such action or suit shall be brought after the expiration of three years from the date of payment. The second plea alleges that the action was brought in respect thereof after the expiration of three years from certain respective dates of payment therein set out. I agree that the demurrer to this plea should be allowed for the reasons given by Taylor J. I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Windeyer J. and I agree in his observations. (at p383)

5. For the foregoing reasons I think that the appeal should be allowed. (at p383)

I have not been able to understand how in point of principle the As reliance was placed by the plaintiffs upon the decision of the Court in P. J. Magennis Pty. Ltd. v. The Commonwealth [1949] HCA 66; (1949) 80 CLR 382 , a decision in which I was unable to agree, it is satisfactory to find that no member of the Court considers that either as a result of that decision or otherwise the plaintiffs are able to make out any title to relief. (at p48)

2. In my opinion the demurrer should be allowed and the suit dismissed with costs. (at p49)
